## 1. Domain Driven Design

## 2. Agile software development

## 3. Open source software development

## 4. Research-driven design
Orcfax's system requirements were derived from an extensive analysis of blockchain, IT, and legal standards. These are managed in a comprehensive requirements knowledgebase. We also reviewed existing oracle services and completed a comparative analysis of how facts are proven to be authentic and accurate in disciplines such as law, historiograpy, and philosophy.

## 5. Standards compliance
First-generation oracle providers have mostly ignored industry standards and academic research findings that exist outside of the blockchain industry echo chamber. In particular ISO quality standards that provide well-established international guidelines and practices for ensuring the authenticity and accuracy of digital information; the very thing that oracles should be most concerned about. Orcfax stands out because it has been designed from the ground-up to be a standards-compliant, digital record-keeping system.
