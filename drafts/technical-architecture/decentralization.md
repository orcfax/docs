# Decentralization roadmap

## Phase 1: Federated Mainnet Feeds

<br/>
The Orcfax Federated Network of nodes on mainnet will consist of five
independent participants within our side-chain blockchain of validator nodes.
This will allow Orcfax two primary opportunities. First, the federated model
will allow us to supply the subsidized price feeds made possible through the
funds raised through our ISPO; these feeds have been identified through rigorous
analysis of market demand and will be supplied at a regular heartbeat until ISPO
funds run out. Secondly, this provides a controlled opportunity to continue
refining our processes while leveraging key insights and feedback gained
through our Incentivized Testnet.<br/>
<br/>
With that aid, the federated model has been purpose built to be temporary and to
provide value as stated above; we believe that the success of our incentivized
testnet will result in the rapid adoption of our system by additional
participants, which will lead to our full transition to Decentralized Mainnet
feeds.<br/>
<br/>
This phase of our Development Roadmap is projected to run:<br/>
Aug 2023 - March 2024<br/>

## Phase 2: Incentivized Validator Testnet

<br/>
The Orcfax Incentivized Validator Testnet is an opportunity for our community of
users and those interested in operating a validator node to roll up their
sleeves and and get their hands dirty. While these nodes will still leverage
the executables made available through Orcfax, community members will be able to
submit code PRs that implement new data feed types which are COOP compliant and
Orcfax compatible.<br/>
<br/>
In order to secure adequate participation, Orcfax will incentivize the labour of
our validators on testnet.<br/>
<br/>
This phase of our Development Roadmap is projected to run:<br/>
Nov 2023 - March 2024<br/>

## Phase 3: Decentralized Mainnet Feeds

<br/>
Both the federated node model and the Incentivized Testnet have been purpose
built to facilitate additional research and development in the Orcfax goal to
fully decentralize. The Orcfax team is committed to radical decentralization and
from the beginning has structured the project accordingly, with the explicit
intention of ensuring a 100% hand-off of governance and all aspects of the
project to a DAO when possible.<br/>
<br/>
The Orcfax team will continue to actively engage in Cardano community governance
dialogues and model good project behavior in our progression towards full
decentralization. Our team shares the personal and professional philosophy that,
in the end, our primary objective in this movement is to decentralize power. The
Orcfax oracle is just one piece of necessary plumbing infrastructure to
facilitate that progression.<br/>
<br/>
However, the decentralization of a project, its community, and technology
stack-- especially one as sophisticated as the Orcfax oracle platform-- is not a
simple feat and nearly impossible to do correctly from day one. Therefore, we
are on a path of gradual decentralization. The transition to the Decentralized
Mainnet feeds run by independent community validator nodes is only one of the
milestones along that progression.<br/>
<br/>
This phase of our Development Roadmap is projected to run:<br/>
April 2024 - in perpetuity<br/>
