# Fact statement reference

<br/>
Users should not have to trust but should verify. This has driven our system
design which captures and archives the entire Orcfax workflow. From Collection,
to the publication event, the whole data collection process-- including evidence
of the fact statement which got published within a smart contract, along with
the use of it-- all gets bundled into an international standards compliant (ISO)
archival package using bag-it, which is then stored off chain in a decentralized
storage network.<br/>
<br/>
Orcfax, through the practical course of business, will create a massive
decentralized digital archive of facts. These records will be made available
free of charge to any person through the Orcfax Fact Explorer.
<br/>
For the DApp developers or analysts, huge utility and value for their research
will be found within these carefully indexed Fact Statements. Whether to inform
future price action prediction models or train new machine learning models from
verified facts, the value of this archive will grow as users continue to
transact on Cardano. Users will be able to search through this archive by
leveraging the identifying information that hey have at hand. While searching
with more specific information such as a Transaction ID would be the most
efficient, users will be able to drill-down by Feed Type, Publication Date, and
several other metadata tags owing to the rich capture of information through the
Orcfax processes.<br/>
