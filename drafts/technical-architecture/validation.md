# Data validation
<br/>
At launch, the Orcfax Federated Network of nodes on mainnet will consist of five
independent participants within our side-chain blockchain of validator nodes.
However, we believe that the success of our incentivized testnet will result in
the rapid adoption of our system by additional participants. Adoption on mainnet
will be aided in part by the Orcfax staking incentivization model. The goal of
Orcfax being, mass adoption to the point that the system will utilize hundreds
of these independent, geographically and server diverse, nodes.<br/>
<br/>
In order to participate as a validator node, operators will be required to stake
a designated amount of $FACT. In order to drive adoption and equitable access
for participants, the requisite amount of $FACT will be kept relatively low. In
addition to this, the system has been designed not to privilege nodes with stake
above and beyond this set threshold.<br/>
<br/>
Because each node will be implemented using the same software executables, each
node will maintain equivalent technical functionality. What this means in
practice is that each participant will have the exact same technical
specifications, capabilities, and code; each will be capable of executing all
Orcfax processes (e.g. Collection, Validation, Publishing, etc). Importantly,
staking more than the  required $FACT will also not affect a node's chances of
being delegated the responsibility for submitting transactions or increase their
proportional share of pool rewards. These decisions have been made in effort to
positively affect mass-adoption.<br/>
<br/>
In order to create a robust validation process, we have added economic
incentives for data validators. Once participants have installed the Orcfax
Validator Node executables users will be required to stake $FACT to the wallet
created along with their nodes.<br/>
<br/>
Once the operator has established their node within the network, it will take
part in all of the processes outlined within the Technical Architecture section.
After successfully collecting the source data from each of the APIs assigned to
the feed, normalizing the data, and reaching network consensus between peers on
that normalized form, a lottery is held by the oracle protocol to randomly
assign a publication reward of $FACT tokens to one of the successful oracle
nodes. This reward is a share of the publication fee paid by the data Consumer
who requested the publication of a fact statement. This creates the incentive
structure for oracle nodes to participate in the network.<br/>
<br/>
The network will leverage both incentives and disincentives to direct validator
node behaviours.<br/>
Peers are rewarded if they pass authentic information (good actors)<br/>
Peers are penalized if they pass false information (bad actors) and stake will
be slashed<br/>
<br/>
The theory behind these actions is that operators will desire to earn rewards
while acting accordingly so as not to lose them. Using this stake based model
creates the incentive to be an honest actor within the Orcfax validator network.
Additionally, good actors, who continue to participate in the decentralized
Oracle Pool validation rounds, benefit each time Orcfax publishes an authentic
fact as every participating node will receive a fractional reward which is then
added to the operator's stake. However, if a user's node is responsible (whether
intentionally or not) for passing on bad data (bad actor), the network will
slash the stake of that node.<br/>
<br/>
By increasing the number of these nodes, in geographically diverse areas, and on
as many servers as possible, it becomes increasingly unlikely or difficult for
bad actors to to compromise the the data flowing though Orcfax.<br/>
<br/>
The need for this system will only increasingly become more critically relevant
as the world continues to advance and utilize machine learning or other
technologies with the capacity for generating deep fakes and misinformation. The
question, "has something really happened in the real world or not?", will go far
beyond the DeFi space and smart contracts; Orcfax is going to become a critical
anchor for the authenticity and veracity of the information we rely on to
conduct business.<br/>
