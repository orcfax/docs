## 1. Triangulate source data

## 2. Decentralize data validation

## 3. Maximize eUTXO capabilities

## 4. Standardize oracle data formats

## 5. Archive audit logs
What our research has shown is that across a wide-variety of disciplines,
the primary way to prove that information is authentic is by documenting the
process of data collection, revision, and publication and then protecting that
information from alteration while making it easily accessible for reference and
audit.

There are a number of relevant industry standards and practices for this which
have been incorporated into the Orcfax design.

This means that users of the Orcfax oracle service can "trust but verify" the
data that they are relying on to trigger Cardano smart contract decisions. This
will become increasingly more relevant as blockchain infrastructure continues to
expand its social and economic impact.
