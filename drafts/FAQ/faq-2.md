# What is a smart contract?

Smart contracts are software programs that execute conditional logic on
next-generation blockchains like Cardano (e.g. when event X happens, trigger
action Y). Because their source code is immutably stored and run on
decentralized blockchain networks, they constrain the range of permissible user
actions and their effects.

This means that they can reasonably be expected to have the same outcome each
time they are triggered. Therefore smart contracts are often referred to as
having "trustless" qualities. The term "trustless" is a popular word to
characterize blockchain technology because its cryptographic proofs and
distributed consensus algorithms ensure that its shared data is authentic,
accurate, and secure without reliance on a trusted third-party to verify the
information.

Smart contracts are the key enabler for the explosion of the trillion-dollar
DeFi industry. What most people don't realize however, is that the vast majority
of smart contracts are critically dependent on off-chain data provided by a very
small group of oracle service providers.

This is because almost all smart contracts need reliable real-world facts to
serve as inputs to their application logic. This data must be "trustworthy"
because the execution of smart contract logic can have significant economic and
social consequences. Especially considering that the consequences of a
blockchain transaction are irreversible by their very design.

For example:

-   A change in the Bitcoin to ADA price may trigger a limit order in a DeFi
    smart contract.
-   The final score in a sports event may trigger a payout in a betting dApp
    smart contract.
-   An extreme weather event may trigger a payout for a crop insurance smart
    contract.
-   The words spoken in a political speech and authenticated via blockchain
    notarization may trigger policy changes or protests.
