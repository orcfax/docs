# [ARCHIVED] FACT token

## 1. Where can I find the Orcfax tokenomics?
We are in the final stages of the Orcfax whitepaper which will more thoroughly document project tokenomics.

## 2. Will there be a Public/Private sale?

It was important to us that the first distribution of $FACT be community focussed, hence the ISPO which was allocated 10% of total supply.

While we have not yet decided whether to leverage the public or private sale routes for our ICO (or what combination of the two), We have allocated 9% of total supply for token sales. The ICO has no current date as we're waiting for more favorable conditions. However, the sale will be facilitated by [LCX](https://www.lcx.com/) in compliance with Liechtenstein securities regulations.

## 3. When will $FACT be available on DEX?

We do not have a fixed date for this at the moment. However, we are aiming to be listed in Q2. We will create $FACT pools on one or more Cardano DEXs at least two months prior to the first ISPO vesting drop. We have set aside 2% of the fixed supply solely for this purpose. That being said, we won't likely deploy that allotment all at once.

## 4. Is $FACT a utility token?

Yes. $FACT is a true utility token used for staking and rewards in our decentralized oracle pools. It's also the token used to pay for 1st block access to premium data feeds.

## 5. Is there a governance function to $FACT tokens?

For now, $FACT tokens will be used primarily as utility tokens for validator nodes in our decentralized oracle pool; they will also be used by developer/smart contracts that want to pay for datum from one of our fact statement feeds. However, the long-term plan for Orcfax is for it to run 100% autonomously, with maintenance & governance handled by a true DAO. In this DAO, $FACT will have a voting function. With that said, the token will also be available on open market/DEXs which will provide additional opportunities for token holders.

## 6. Where's the Orcfax NFT sale?

There is no identified utility for this product within our project. Because of this, there is no plan to issue an Orcfax NFT of any kind.
