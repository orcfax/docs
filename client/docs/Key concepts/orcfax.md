# The Orcfax solution
Orcfax is the most comprehensive solution to the [oracle problem](faq#what-is-the-oracle-problem) because it is designed to be a standards-compliant recordkeeping system that integrates on-chain publication with decentralized data collection, validation, and archiving. 

The sytem requirements were derived from an extensive analysis of blockchain, IT, and legal standards, existing oracle services, as well as a wide review of how facts are proven to be authentic and accurate in disciplines such as law, historiograpy, and philosophy. 

First-generation oracle providers have mostly ignored industry standards and academic research findings that exist outside their immediate circles. In particular those International Organization for Standardization (ISO) quality standards that provide well-established guidelines and practices for ensuring the authenticity and accuracy of digital information; the very thing that oracles should be most concerned about.

What our research has shown is that across a wide-variety of disciplines, the primary way to prove that information is authentic is by documenting the process of data collection, revision, and publication and then making that information easily auditable. 

Users of oracle services should be able to "trust but verify" the data that are relying on to trigger smart contracts with potentially significant social and economic impact.

Orcfax generates and archives provenance audit logs on the Arweave permaweb network. These archived records are inextricably linked back to the relevant transactions on the Cardano blockchain.
