From Collection, Normalization, Calculation, to Validation and the publication event, the entire process generates audit logs that are bundled into structured archival information packages which then get stored off chain in a\xa0decentralized storage network called Arweave. The originally queried datum, the Fact Statement from which it is pulled, the source data and the algorithms utilized for calculation, every step will be transparently available for the Cardano community. The result of this is that Orcfax will effectively create a secondary product from these processes, which is the development of a giant data lake of all the data that has ever been successfully processed by the Orcfax Oracle network. This product, while secondary at present, is itself a colossal value add in terms of reusability.

All of these extra facts enable auditability, and even have value off chain as well; the Orcfax process has been developed to provide solutions to larger, more global, issues around trust and auditability. Society at large for years has grappled with the problem of how to preserve our digital information and the memory of society; how do we keep information online and how do we finance these efforts in perpetuity?
