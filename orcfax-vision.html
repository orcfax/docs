<p>Oracles are a critical piece of blockchain infrastructure that when overlooked,
or under-utilized, can have severe impacts on DeFi protocols.</p>
<p>An Oracle&#x27;s primary role is to provide data about the real world, which the
blockchain is ignorant of. When oracles bring this data on chain, it opens up a
world of new possibilities for protocols which can utilize the data to underpin
business logic and to serve as inputs to trigger smart contract execution.</p>
<p>However, the heavy reliance on oracles to provide these inputs, and the trust
that consuming dApps must have in the data being utilized, creates new risk
vectors: the risk of oracles being compromised, and the risk that oracles will
feed blockchain smart contracts with false or inaccurate information; this is
part of the &quot;oracle problem&quot;.</p>
<p>The Cardano blockchain is a permissionless, public network, and while this fact
greatly benefits users and developers, it also means that anyone can develop
software or services for the purpose of providing smart contracts with data, all
while claiming to fulfill the role of an oracle. We at Orcfax strongly object to
this position.</p>
<p>The ability for software to be recognized as an &quot;oracle&quot; is reserved for those
which have been intentionally designed to solve the &quot;oracle problem&quot;, and DeFi
protocols should look critically at any which do not explicitly address this
issue.</p>
<p>The Oracle problem represents several interconnected issues regarding trust;
Orcfax believes that solving the oracle problem means designing a solution from
the bottom up with a focus on addressing decentralization and auditability.</p>
<p>Recent claims within the Cardano community of newly launched oracle solutions
mean that users, now more than ever, need to assess the services being offered,
the logic behind their design, how they are executed, and the implications of
their use.</p>
<p>What follows is a short introduction to what Orcfax has identified as critical
aspects of an oracle. It is our belief that solutions should be able to
demonstrate these aspects in order to claim that their solution is in fact an
oracle, and that it&#x27;s addressing the &quot;oracle problem&quot; through the its provided
service.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="The Orcfax oracle vision" src="/assets/images/2024--Orcfax-oracle-vision-5c7f71f512241291bd54c5db32e0aa38.png" width="3840" height="2300" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="breaking-it-down">Breaking it down<a href="#breaking-it-down" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Breaking it down" title="Direct link to Breaking it down">​</a></h2>
<p>The critical aspects of an oracle solution outlined in the above table
demonstrate the Orcfax vision for Cardano oracles and how they should be
designed in order to effectively address the oracle problem. To add more
context, and to help users further appreciate how important these are, we unpack
each of the above aspects, their significance, and how the Orcfax solution
provides an answer.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="triangulation-of-data-points-vs-single-source-data-points">Triangulation of data points vs Single source data points<a href="#triangulation-of-data-points-vs-single-source-data-points" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Triangulation of data points vs Single source data points" title="Direct link to Triangulation of data points vs Single source data points">​</a></h3>
<p>To avoid single points of failure or attack, Orcfax has adopted the principle of
triangulation, which is concerned with the utilization of multiple methods, or
sources of information, in order to derive a comprehensive understanding of
phenomena in the world; this principle also aids in testing the validity of
source information by providing the ability to compare data across sources. In
practice, the principle of triangulation is leveraged by our project to develop
robust Orcfax nodes. Each of these nodes are required to query a min of 3
primary sources as a validation check. If one source fails, gets hacked, or
contributes outlier data, then the remaining reliable sources can still be
utilized to derive authentic values.</p>
<p>Orcfax released its first price feed (ADA-USD) with three primary sources being
leveraged in accordance with this principle; however, updates to this feed and
additional products benefit from an increased pool of primary source data
providers, which enhances their reliability and security.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="decentralized--permissionless-pool-of-validators-vs-off-chain-kyc-ed-validators">Decentralized &amp; permissionless pool of validators vs Off-chain kyc-ed validators<a href="#decentralized--permissionless-pool-of-validators-vs-off-chain-kyc-ed-validators" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Decentralized &amp; permissionless pool of validators vs Off-chain kyc-ed validators" title="Direct link to Decentralized &amp; permissionless pool of validators vs Off-chain kyc-ed validators">​</a></h3>
<p>Requiring data validators to go through regulatory know-your-customer (KYC)
processes and/or requiring individuals to sign contracts goes against the very
decentralization ethos that Orcfax is championing. <strong>Truly decentralized
networks are permissionless</strong>; this means that the only limiting factor for
network participants should be their ability to meet the minimal technical
requirement identified for node operation.</p>
<p>It is our belief that those sympathetic to the goals of decentralization should
strongly object to oracle solutions that require users to rely on trusted third
party companies to act as gatekeepers for, what should be, a community resource.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="aggregated--validated-by-orcfax-vs-aggregated-and-validated-by-dapp">Aggregated &amp; validated by Orcfax vs Aggregated and validated by dApp<a href="#aggregated--validated-by-orcfax-vs-aggregated-and-validated-by-dapp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Aggregated &amp; validated by Orcfax vs Aggregated and validated by dApp" title="Direct link to Aggregated &amp; validated by Orcfax vs Aggregated and validated by dApp">​</a></h3>
<p>The oracle problem represents significant risks for dApps and has implications
for the data that their smart contracts rely upon in order to execute
transactions. However, dApps can, and should, reduce their risk significantly by
integrating oracle feeds and leveraging input data that comes from a
decentralized validator pool, run by independent operators.</p>
<p>Several solutions across Cardano have developed their own in-house, and often ad
hoc, oracle solutions in order to meet the data needs of their smart contracts.
Whether this has been for lack of an alternative solution or incompatibility
with solution providers on offer, dApps inject significant risk into their
protocols by relying on oracle solutions which have not been diligently
researched and purpose built.</p>
<p>Orcfax can help dApps focus on their core services by doing the data gathering,
aggregation, and validation work, which would otherwise unnecessarily slow down
smart contract execution, increase transaction costs, and introduce new attack
vectors for their dApps.</p>
<p>It can&#x27;t be stressed enough, when dApps and protocols only use their own in
house data solutions, or do their own external data gathering, they create
serious attack vectors. Choosing not to leverage purpose built solutions can
also result in justifiable mistrust amongst the users of their DeFi products, as
it is often their assets which are put at risk by these design decisions.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="heartbeat--on-demand-feeds-vs-heartbeat-feeds-only">Heartbeat &amp; on-demand feeds vs Heartbeat feeds only<a href="#heartbeat--on-demand-feeds-vs-heartbeat-feeds-only" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Heartbeat &amp; on-demand feeds vs Heartbeat feeds only" title="Direct link to Heartbeat &amp; on-demand feeds vs Heartbeat feeds only">​</a></h3>
<p>The number of potential use cases for oracle feeds are numerous, and they are
increasing every day as developers create exciting new products, and as
blockchains position themselves for increased adoption. While there can be
overlap in the data needs of dApps and their smart contracts, many of these use
cases have their own distinct requirements in regards to when data must be
available on chain.</p>
<p>Orcfax recognizes these differences and the unique needs of integrators. Because
of this, we have developed services to suit and accommodate dApp requirements.
Our solution will now support two distinct publication models: heartbeat and
on-demand.</p>
<p>Our ADA-USD feed went live on mainnet by leveraging the first of these
publication options– an Orcfax hourly heartbeat publication model with deviation
monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>The heartbeat publication model</strong> gives integrators the ability to access data
at regular intervals which can be set according to their needs (e.g. once per
hour). More about this publication model can be found in the heartbeat
<a href="/publication-models#the-heartbeat-publication-model">publication model</a></p>
<p><strong>The on-demand publication model</strong> allows complete flexibility and gives dApps
even more control of data use by allowing them to request data collection,
validation and publication whenever it&#x27;s needed by their smart contracts. More
about this publication model can be found in the on-demand
<a href="/publication-models#the-on-demand-publication-model">publication model</a></p>

<p>When something goes wrong with software, every user, including non-developers,
should be able to audit all aspects of the processes involved— blockchain
oracles are no different. Users must have the ability to follow detailed
documentation that recounts the processes, their outputs, and how the steps
taken resulted in the oracle values published on-chain and utilized by smart
contracts.</p>
<p>Not only should this documentation exist in a way that is easy to access, the
information needs to be intelligible for users of diverse skill sets and to
future audiences that may lack context.</p>
<p>Orcfax has addressed both of these requirements by creating human and
machine-readable audit trails of all Orcfax solution processes: data collection,
normalization, aggregation, validation, and publication. This is made possible
by leveraging standards-compliant record-keeping practices that ensure the links
between all the on-chain and off-chain components are immutable, inextricable,
and trustworthy.</p>
<p>While these records can be interrogated manually, we have developed a
user-friendly <a href="https://explorer.orcfax.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Explorer</a> interface that makes surfacing these audit
trails simple and convenient so that users of Orcfax feeds can &quot;Trust But
Verify&quot;. The explorer was developed as a direct response to the disregard that
other solutions have shown regarding the right of users to conduct their own
audits, the need to prioritize accessibility, and ease of use; unlike other
oracle solutions, the Orcfax Explorer does not require expert knowledge of
Cardano eUTXO architecture, nor does it force users to execute complicated
forensic processes to follow on-chain transactions. Everything users need is
made available at their finger tips.</p>

<p>This point complements the previous by focusing on the value of re-use; Orcfax
strongly believes that there is significant secondary value for real-world data
that has gone through vigorous authenticity and accuracy checks, like the
information that Orcfax publishes to the Cardano blockchain. Therefore, our
audit trail packages are marked up using a number of key industry standards
including <a href="https://json-ld.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSON-LD</a>, <a href="https://schema.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schema.org</a>, and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8493/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IETF
Bagit</a>.</p>
<p>The archival packages are designed to preserve on-chain data, and their context,
all while using identifiers which link all associated records and creates a
permanent link back to the on-chain Cardano transactions containing the relevant
Orcfax datum. The result is that Orcfax provides blockchain-based trust anchors
for Fact Statements about the real world that are now highly interoperable and
re-usable beyond Web3 (e.g. training AI models on validated real-world Facts).</p>
<p>Orcfax is committed to continuing its R&amp;D into new ways to reuse feed data and
to leverage this &quot;data lake of validated facts&quot; for new value-added services and
products.</p>

<p>Cardano was designed to off-load as much transaction processing as possible to
off-chain components in order to minimize on-chain computations and thereby
dramatically reduce transaction costs. The Cardano blockchain has been able to
accomplish this without significant security compromises. The Orcfax oracle
architecture has been intentionally designed to follow the same design and
delegation principles.</p>
<p>Orcfax has managed to reduce on-chain interaction to a single certified data
publication event, all while providing linkages that connect on-chain datapoints
with a complete history of supporting documentation related to all off-chain
processes; these records are made available permissionlessly through
decentralized storage, and have standards-based security guarantees for their
links back to the on-chain data.</p>
<p>Other oracle solutions require users to juggle the handling of numerous NFTs and
a complicated series of inter-dependent on-chain transactions to support their
workflow, each adding transaction fees along the way. These other solutions are
neither efficient nor cost effective for their integrators and end users.</p>
<p>Orcfax has designed its solution with a commitment to minimal transaction fees
for integrators, making it the most cost-effective and long-term sustainable
oracle solution on Cardano. And R&amp;D continues as Orcfax continues to find
strategies to optimize feed publication and to maximize integrator ease of use.</p>

<p>While the Orcfax project was initially established through its incorporation as
a company in the British Virgin Islands, and has continued to leverage this
position for development, this was always meant to be temporary. The sole
purpose of the Orcfax Ltd. company is to develop, and launch, the Orcfax Network
while also performing custodial duties for the FACT token.</p>
<p>It is our desire that as soon as specific implementation targets are reached,
Orcfax Ltd. will dissolve itself and initiate the transfer of Orcfax Network
operations to the Orcfax Foundation, which will be operated as a decentralized
autonomous organization (DAO).</p>
<p>The Orcfax commitment to DAO governance was enshrined in our tokenomics wherein
5% of the total $FACT supply was reserved, within its own distinct ada handle,
for the sole purpose of funding the operations of the Orcfax Foundation. After
Orcfax Ltd. has delivered the full roadmap and has dissolved itself, the DAO
will become the recipient of the network share of $FACT data feed fees.</p>
<p>We envision that the DAO will be run via stake-based voting using $FACT to
decide on housekeeping matters, hiring contractors to monitor daily network
operations, hiring developers to add new features, to make decisions on network
parameters such as transaction fee percentages, and whether or not to add or
remove certain feeds.</p>
<p>Importantly, current Orcfax activities and development have been largely funded
via our successful FACT token launch. Many other oracle providers have been
funded by venture capitalists (VCs) who are averse to any type of DAO/community
based governance that affects their ability to get a return on their investment
(e.g. pull value out of the oracle project). We object to these kinds of project
financing strategies as they effectively tie the project&#x27;s hands and can prevent
the development and fostering of decentralization; alignment with VCs also
causes the project to be beholden to them, whereas we prefer to be beholden to
our community.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="open-source-vs-closed-source">Open-source vs Closed-source<a href="#open-source-vs-closed-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open-source vs Closed-source" title="Direct link to Open-source vs Closed-source">​</a></h3>
<p>The Orcfax team stalwartly believes in the open-source software ethos, which
prioritizes equitable access by allowing users to copy, inspect, and alter
software source code for the benefit of their own projects. Another key benefit
is that this creates a unique auditing environment; the concept of, &quot;more eyes
on the code&quot;, demonstrates this phenomena and is meant to convey scenarios where
it&#x27;s more likely that developers outside the core team are able to spot, and
willing to help fix, any bugs or errors in the software.</p>
<p>The Orcfax project itself leans heavily on other free and open-source software
components, and stands on the shoulders of developers who have committed their
work to the benefit of the public. Because of this, we recognize the
responsibility of our project to pay it forward, and this will be done through
the software which we open-source.</p>
<p>While we have already open-sourced a number of Orcfax projects, we will continue
to do so as components enter production and maturity until we have incrementally
open-sourced the Orcfax oracle solution.</p>

<p>We believe that the purposeful design of the Orcfax solution and the
incorporation of the above critical aspects demonstrates how Orcfax sets itself
apart from other oracle solution attempts in the Cardano space. With that said,
Orcfax isn&#x27;t finished; our team continues to research the oracle problem, to
develop decentralized solutions, and continues to focus on providing data
services which users can trust, but verify. This is the Orcfax difference, and
and what separates our solution from the others.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/auditability"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Auditability</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/roadmap"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Roadmap</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#breaking-it-down" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Breaking it down</a><ul><li><a href="#triangulation-of-data-points-vs-single-source-data-points" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Triangulation of data points vs Single source data points</a></li><li><a href="#decentralized--permissionless-pool-of-validators-vs-off-chain-kyc-ed-validators" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Decentralized &amp;
