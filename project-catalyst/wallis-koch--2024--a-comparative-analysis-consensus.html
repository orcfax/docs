<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="abstract">Abstract<a href="#abstract" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Abstract" title="Direct link to Abstract">​</a></h2>
<p>This paper provides a brief comparison of various consensus protocols which were
assessed against an initial understanding of consensus requirements and purpose
being for Orcfax to ascertain whether an existing consensus protocol, as a drop
in solution for Orcfax, adequately meets its needs for: high throughput, low
latency, fault tolerance, and scalability in a multi-validator environment.
Based on the analysis of each consensus protocol and the initial <em>Must Have</em>
requirements identified by Orcfax, none of the reviewed consensus protocols
fully meets the needs of EchoNet. However, the most interesting line for
additional inquiry is CometBFT which aligned with several of the core Orcfax
requirements for a consensus protocol.</p>
<p>The other consensus protocols examined in this paper were: Hydra, Hydrozoa,
Iagon, Lodestar, Midgard, NEM, Raft, Snowball, CometBFT, and VeChainThor. Each
was assessed for its efficiency, reliability, scalability, as well as its
capacity to support a decentralized, real-time data validation network.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="1-introduction">1. Introduction<a href="#1-introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Introduction" title="Direct link to 1. Introduction">​</a></h2>

<p>In the context of decentralized networks, consensus is the process by which
network participants (or validators) reach an agreement on the validity of
transactions and the state of the blockchain, without the need for a central
authority. Validators are tasked with collectively verifying, approving, and
adding new transactions to the blockchain, ensuring the integrity and
consistency of the distributed ledger. In PoS networks, consensus relies on
validators who are chosen to create new blocks or validate transactions based on
their stake.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="12-what-is-orcfax-and-what-is-its-need-for-consensus">1.2 What is Orcfax and what is its need for consensus?<a href="#12-what-is-orcfax-and-what-is-its-need-for-consensus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1.2 What is Orcfax and what is its need for consensus?" title="Direct link to 1.2 What is Orcfax and what is its need for consensus?">​</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://orcfax.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orcfax</a> is an aspiring decentralized oracle on the Cardano blockchain.
An oracle is a service that makes information available to the context of code
executing within the blockchain. This information is used to determine whether
transactions may be deemed valid. Thus those effected by such transactions need
to have trust in the oracle system. By its nature the information from an oracle
does not come with the guarantees of the blockchain, and so to be useful the
oracle must present its own integrity model. This model serves as the
justification of why anyone should have confidence the oracle service provider
is accurate and reliable.</p>
<p>The data Orcfax provides is arranged into feeds. A feed is generally time series
data. For example the <a href="https://explorer.orcfax.io/feeds/CER/ADA-USD/facts/9a61d41b-fc3b-4ca1-965f-5e7eb4d2b7af" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA/USD</a> exchange rate.</p>
<p>A feed can be thought of as a data pipeline. Data is periodically collected from
numerous sources. This data is then subjected to a normalization and aggregation
process which outputs a statement belonging to a feed. Each execution of the
data pipeline results in a statement.</p>
<p>Currently, the Orcfax network is centralized. This means that at present, the
integrity model presented by Orcfax is one of authority; this is where a single
centralized authority provides information. This integrity model argues that the
combination of legal repercussions, and financial and reputation damage ensures
the data provider (Orcfax) is highly motivated to report information accurately
and reliably.</p>
<p>An advantage of this approach is that it is relatively simple. A disadvantage of
the approach is that it has a single point of corruption and or failure; it
relies solely on a single entity to be honest and competent.</p>
<p>The goal of Orcfax since its inception has been to develop towards a
decentralized network. The decentralized Orcfax network will be EchoNet, it&#x27;s
participants will be referred to as &quot;Orcfax validators&quot;, and these validators
will be recognized as such through their ownership of specific assets on the
Cardano L1. The integrity model presented through this network will be one of
consensus; If a decentralized set of participants are to provide a service such
as an oracle service, they must first agree on the information they provide.
That is, they must find consensus; this must be accomplished given the
assumption that most but not all participants are honest and competent while
some participants of the network may be malicious or incompetent.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="13-the-role-of-the-validator">1.3 The role of the validator<a href="#13-the-role-of-the-validator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1.3 The role of the validator" title="Direct link to 1.3 The role of the validator">​</a></h3>
<p>Orcfax Validators will be expected to execute a number of tasks, many of which
require consensus. A non-exhaustive list of the tasks that validators must do
includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>running the existing data collectors and feeds</li>
<li>ensuring maintenance of existing code base</li>
<li>ensuring health of data sources / definitions of feeds</li>
<li>sunsetting and discontinuing underused feeds</li>
<li>defining and developing new feeds</li>
<li>ensuring the health of the network (removing bad validators and collectors)</li>
<li>maintaining optimal remuneration parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>In the present proposal we are mostly concerned with consensus as it is involved
in the running of existing feeds. We hope that the underlying techniques can be
directly extended to the other tasks contexts.</p>
<p>The running of the existing collectors and feeds is synonymous with the task of
producing statements.</p>
<p>A statement is the interface between Orcfax and its consumers. Consumers are the
users of Cardano who are in some way implicated in transactions that consume
Orcfax data. For example, an individual who took a collateralized loan via a
dApp that integrated Orcfax price feeds, and that was liquidated when exchange
rates changed is a consumer.</p>
<p>A statement is <em>published</em> on the L1 only if it has a valid signature. Currently
a single signer is used. It is envisioned that a FROST-like method would allow
the transition from a single signer to a multi-signature (k of n) arrangement.
However, FROST is a multisig scheme, not a consensus algorithm; FROST does not
address the question of how consensus was reached. For these reasons, FROST is
not discussed further in this paper beyond the following: Orcfax may be able to
use FROST in the future to cheaply check that consensus was reached for a given
statement. However, Orcfax is not committed to this design and this aspect may
be change if it is deemed desirable.</p>

<p>One aim that Orcfax has for its implementation of consensus is to uphold or
secure the health of the network in spite of participants behaving badly: either
by incompetence or with malicious intent. For this reason It may be helpful to
flesh out <em>What actions are deemed bad for the health or security of the
network?</em> the following is a non-exhaustive list demonstrating our current
understanding.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="141-an-unresponsive-participant">1.4.1 An unresponsive participant<a href="#141-an-unresponsive-participant" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1.4.1 An unresponsive participant" title="Direct link to 1.4.1 An unresponsive participant">​</a></h4>

Overview of consensus protocols">​</a></h2>
<p>As stated previously, this paper does not begin to cover the breadth of
consensus protocols being used across the multitude of blockchain networks.
Instead, a sample set of consensus implementations were selected which primarily
utilize Proof of Stake (PoS) as this is an Orcfax network requirement, but some
alternative consensus mechanisms are also explored.</p>
<p>These protocols have been assessed against a preliminary understanding of Orcfax
needs for consensus within EchoNet, the role of Orcfax validators, the
identified Must Have requirements, their efficiency, and reliability.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="21-hydra">2.1 Hydra<a href="#21-hydra" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.1 Hydra" title="Direct link to 2.1 Hydra">​</a></h3>
<p>Hydra is an L2 scaling solution designed specifically for the Cardano
blockchain. Its purpose is to enhance transaction throughput and reduce latency
by creating “Hydra heads,” which are separate, parallelized mini-ledgers that
allow for fast and efficient transaction processing independently of the main
Cardano blockchain <a href="https://hydra.family/head-protocol/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydra Protocol, 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Each Hydra head is presented as a scalable, parallel processing environment that
maintains strong connections to Cardano’s primary chain, ensuring secure and
synchronized state transitions without burdening the main network. The Hydra
protocol functions by offloading transaction processing to these Hydra heads.
Each Hydra head can be thought of as a decentralized, mini consensus environment
where nodes execute transactions and reach consensus independently, but
unanimously within the head. These transactions are later aggregated back to the
Cardano main chain.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the largest number of participants demonstrated in a tx
is 57. Presumably, this is the most that are able to participate before some tx
limit is reached.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="211-hydra-against-requirements">2.1.1 Hydra against requirements<a href="#211-hydra-against-requirements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.1.1 Hydra against requirements" title="Direct link to 2.1.1 Hydra against requirements">​</a></h4>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong>: Hydra as an out of the box solution for Orcfax is immediately
ruled out. The reliance of heads on unanimous consent means that one malicious
actor could have significant impacts on network reliability and efficacy.
However, it might be possible to adapt Hydra by relaxing unanimous consent.
Otherwise, Hydra is not too far off meeting the core design requirements; Issues
with participation count being limited to 57 might be circumvented for Orcfax&#x27;s
needs. It may also be possible that hydra brings additional benefits of
alignment with the L1.</p>

<p>While no working implementation could be found, Hydrozoa claims to be
specifically designed to improve the performance and reliability of consensus in
environments with a large number of validators. It is aimed at enhancing
Cardano’s decentralized application layer by offering a framework for handling
high-frequency, multi-node validation, which is a core requirement for real-time
data oracles like Orcfax.</p>

<p>Iagon is a decentralized cloud computing and storage platform, built to leverage
blockchain technology for distributed storage and compute resource management
<a href="https://docs.iagon.com/developers/developers-guide/developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iagon, 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Iagon uses decentralized network infrastructure to store data in a secure,
distributed manner. Its primary use case is in cloud-based applications where
decentralized data storage and processing are prioritized over real-time
consensus. This decentralized approach enables Iagon to deliver reliable storage
services across a network without requiring a traditional high-speed consensus
protocol, making it more suited to applications requiring data integrity and
accessibility over rapid, consensus-driven data validation.</p>
<p>Iagon operates by distributing data across a network of decentralized nodes, and
claims to be effective at protecting against data loss or tampering, by
redundantly storing and managing data across the network <a href="https://docs.iagon.com/developers/developers-guide/developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iagon, 2023</a>.</p>
<p>However, a lack of available resources and information constrain the ability to
say more about the solution; at the time of writing many links presented in the
docs that would be helpful to explain iagon do not seem to exist. It is not
entirely clear if it is, or will be, a sidechain or L2.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong>: While Iagon presents itself as a compelling consensus solution
utilizing a unique proof of storage architecture, the ability for Orcfax to
assess Iagon&#x27;s architecture and design against its own needs is highly

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="24-lodestar">2.4 Lodestar<a href="#24-lodestar" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.4 Lodestar" title="Direct link to 2.4 Lodestar">​</a></h3>
<p>Lodestar is a JavaScript-based consensus client for the Ethereum 2.0
<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/gasper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gasper</a> consensus mechanism developed to implement Ethereum’s
Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model through the Beacon chain <a href="https://chainsafe.github.io/lodestar/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lodestar,
2023</a>. As an Ethereum client, Lodestar enables nodes to participate in
the Ethereum 2.0 PoS ecosystem, enhancing scalability and security while
supporting Ethereum’s transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to PoS. Lodestar
primarily serves as a foundational client for Ethereum’s staking and consensus
layers, designed to handle transactions securely and efficiently in a
decentralized network environment.</p>
<p>Lodestar operates within Ethereum’s PoS framework, where validators secure the
network by staking ETH and performing consensus duties. Lodestar’s JavaScript
architecture makes it accessible and versatile, although it is fundamentally
tailored to Ethereum’s ecosystem rather than cross-chain or for Cardano
integrations. <a href="https://chainsafe.github.io/lodestar/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lodestar, 2023</a>.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="241-loadstar-against-requirements">2.4.1 Loadstar against requirements<a href="#241-loadstar-against-requirements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.4.1 Loadstar against requirements" title="Direct link to 2.4.1 Loadstar against requirements">​</a></h4>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Lodestar’s PoS model on Ethereum is effective in supporting
moderate transaction throughput, with some benchmarks showing between 1000 to
1250 TPS (<a href="https://migalabs.io/blog/post/ethereum-hardware-resource-analysis-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethereum Hardware Resource Analysis Update, 2024</a>), but its
throughput capacity is limited by Ethereum’s network constraints, which are
different from Cardano’s capabilities. The Beacon chain, while efficient within
Ethereum, would require additional adaptation to meet the low-latency (T) and
high-throughput (V) demands of Orcfax.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong>: Ethereum 2.0’s PoS consensus model provides network security by
requiring block finality to reach 2/3 consensus among nodes (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/gasper/#what-is-finality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is
Finality</a>), which exceeds Orcfax’s security and fault tolerance needs.
However, its reliance on Ethereum’s staking mechanisms and reward systems means
that its security model is tightly linked to Ethereum’s staking protocol, which
may not fully translate to an Orcfax use case.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong>: The primary challenges with adapting Lodestar for Orcfax are its
dependency on Ethereum’s PoS structure and its limited throughput compared to
Cardano’s capabilities. While Lodestar’s JavaScript-based design offers
flexibility, its reliance on Ethereum’s Beacon chain constrains its
applicability for Orcfax, which requires faster and more flexible data consensus
within the Cardano ecosystem. Integrating Lodestar might require developing
custom bridge or cross-chain protocols and potentially redesigning aspects of
its staking incentives.</p>

<p>Midgard is presented as a protocol used within decentralized liquidity networks
like Thorchain to manage and update liquidity states in real-time. The solution
claims to be designed to facilitate high-throughput data handling in DeFi

fault tolerance (BFT), ensuring stability and consensus even in environments
with malicious nodes.</p>
<p>However, a lack of available resources and information constrain the ability to
ascertain how well the solution meets the needs of Orcfax; at the time of
writing many links such as those for documentation and the whitepaper resolve to
&quot;what is Midgard?&quot;, which provides insufficient information to say more.</p>

<p>NEM (New Economy Movement) utilizes a unique consensus mechanism called
Proof-of-Importance (PoI), designed to reward participants based on their
activity and contribution within the network <a href="https://github.com/NemProject/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEM Project, 2023</a>. Unlike
traditional PoW or PoS models, PoI evaluates network importance by factoring in
a participant’s transaction history, frequency of transactions, and network
holdings, promoting active engagement and network utility. NEM’s PoI model is
primarily used within its ecosystem for facilitating transactions, but its
unique activity-based approach to consensus offers an alternative to traditional
staking mechanisms, prioritizing network participation over token holding.</p>
<p>In NEM’s PoI model, participants earn rewards based on their calculated
importance score, which is determined by an algorithmic assessment of
transaction activity, account age, and other engagement metrics. This approach
claims to discourages centralization by rewarding activity and connectivity
within the network rather than relying on volume-based staking, as seen in some
PoS models.</p>
<p>NEM’s PoI nodes validate transactions and reach consensus without requiring
significant computational resources, claiming that it&#x27;s efficient for moderate
throughput applications; however, specific figures to back this claim could not
be found. The system’s activity-based scoring method is intended to encourage
nodes to remain active and to contribute consistently, thereby fostering a
stable network with distributed validator incentives <a href="https://github.com/NemProject/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEM Project, 2023</a>.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="261-nem-against-requirements">2.6.1 NEM against requirements<a href="#261-nem-against-requirements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.6.1 NEM against requirements" title="Direct link to 2.6.1 NEM against requirements">​</a></h4>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: NEM’s PoI model is optimized for moderate transaction
throughput, performing well for applications requiring steady transaction
handling without the resource intensity of PoW or the latency which its docs
associate with high-volume PoS networks. However, for Orcfax, which has
identified high-throughput validation for real-time data as a requirement, NEM’s
capabilities may not fully align, as its focus on engagement-based incentives
could limit its transaction speed and scalability in high-frequency scenarios
<a href="https://github.com/NemProject/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEM Project, 2023</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong>: By encouraging active participation over token staking, NEM’s
PoI model provides an alternative structure for data integrity. However, the
reliability of NEM’s PoI is highly contingent on user activity and engagement,
making it less ideal for applications where consistent, rapid consensus is
necessary regardless of participation patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong>: The main challenge with NEM’s PoI for Orcfax is its reliance on
engagement-based incentives, which may not adequately support the
high-throughput and continuous validation needs of a decentralized oracle
network.</p>

<p>Raft-rs is the rust implementation of the Raft consensus protocol, which is
primarily used in distributed systems where consistency and reliability are
prioritized over throughput and scalability <a href="https://github.com/tikv/raft-rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raft, 2023</a>. Raft is
designed for use in closed networks where trusted nodes operate cooperatively.
The network elects a single leader among nodes, who then coordinates the
validation and replication of data entries across follower nodes, ensuring
consistency and data integrity. If the leader fails, a new one is elected to
take over the validation and data coordination duties.</p>
<p>Raft’s simplicity and leader-based model make it suitable for smaller networks
where high levels of trust exist among nodes, but it may be less resilient in
environments where malicious nodes must be accounted for.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="271-raft-against-requirements">2.7.1 Raft against requirements<a href="#271-raft-against-requirements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.7.1 Raft against requirements" title="Direct link to 2.7.1 Raft against requirements">​</a></h4>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Raft is highly efficient in terms of latency and resource use
within small, closed networks where it can maintain high levels of consistency
without the complexity of large-scale byzantine fault tolerance <a href="https://raft.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raft,

<p><strong>Reliability</strong>: Raft is reliable for smaller networks where nodes trusted and
cooperative, as its leader-election process ensures data consistency. However,
in a decentralized oracle network with potentially adversarial participants,
Raft’s inability to accommodate malicious actors presents a vulnerability,
especially where resilience against malicious nodes is essential.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong>: Raft’s primary challenge as a drop in solution for Orcfax
adapting lies in its closed, leader-based consensus model, which is incompatible
with decentralized oracle requirements; the Orcfax network is being designed as
a decentralized network and must be able to deal with malicious nodes</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="28-avalanche">2.8 Avalanche<a href="#28-avalanche" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.8 Avalanche" title="Direct link to 2.8 Avalanche">​</a></h3>
<p>The Avalanche consensus protocol, utilizing the Snowball consensus algorithm,
boasts a probabilistic, high-throughput consensus that emphasizes rapid, secure
agreement despite adversarial conditions <a href="https://docs.avax.network/learn/avalanche-consensus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avalanche, 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Avalanche consensus, which includes Snowball, is designed to achieve consensus
across a large number of validators by relying on repeated probabilistic
sampling and gossip protocols. This structure makes it resilient, scalable, and
well-suited to environments where high transaction rates and fast finality are
critical, such as decentralized finance and data validation in oracle systems.</p>
<p>Snowball works through a process called metastable consensus, where nodes
repeatedly sample one another to reach agreement on data validity. Nodes query
others in the network to confirm decisions, using probabilistic algorithms to
ensure convergence on a single outcome. This process allows Snowball to achieve
consensus without requiring all nodes to agree simultaneously, reducing latency
and enabling high throughput. The probabilistic nature of Snowball’s consensus
claims to allow the network to scale to thousands of validators without
compromising security or speed <a href="https://salemal.medium.com/snowflake-to-avalanche-a-novel-metastable-consensus-protocol-family-for-cryptocurrencies-961f2b32ee94" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avalanche, 2023</a>; this exceeds the
requirements identified by Orcfax for throughput and scalability.</p>

<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Snowball’s consensus mechanism is highly efficient, achieving
fast transaction processing and finality with low latency. Its ability to handle
thousands of TPS and its rapid consensus through probabilistic sampling exceeds
Orcfax’s high-throughput needs. Snowball’s low-latency processing also aligns
well with the requirements for rapid data updates in real-time oracle systems,
as it allows data to be processed and validated almost instantaneously across a
decentralized network <a href="https://docs.avax.network/learn/avalanche-consensus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avalanche, 2023</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong>: Snowball’s design includes resilience against adversarial
environments, enabling it to handle up to one-third malicious nodes without
compromising consensus integrity. This fault tolerance capability meets Orcfax
requirements where maintaining secure data validation in an open network is a
priority. The probabilistic sampling method Snowball uses reduces the impact of
malicious actors by making it difficult for any small group of nodes to
influence the network’s consensus direction, ensuring reliable and secure data
handling <a href="https://docs.avax.network/learn/avalanche-consensus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avalanche, 2023</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong>: While Snowball exceeds many of the orcfax requirements, an
Orcfax implementation could be labour intensive. Not only is the Snowball design
in itself complicated, its operation within the Avalanche’s network could mean
additional complexities relating to bridging protocols.</p>

<p>CometBFT, formerly known as Tendermint Core, is the GO implementation of the BFT
consensus protocol which is primarily used within the Cosmos ecosystem
<a href="https://github.com/cometbft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CometBFT, 2023</a>. Known for achieving low-latency finality and high
throughput, CometBFT is designed for blockchains requiring quick transaction
finality, making it popular among interoperable and multi-chain ecosystems. It
combines BFT consensus with PoS incentives to create a secure, decentralized
structure capable of handling moderate-to-high transaction volumes in
adversarial environments.</p>
<p>CometBFT operates through a two-phase BFT consensus model that allows validator
nodes to reach agreement on the inclusion of transactions. Each validator
proposes and votes on blocks, and transactions are finalized within seconds,
ensuring quick data validation and low-latency processing. CometBFT is
structured to handle both inter-chain and intra-chain communication, making it
adaptable to multi-chain environments. Its implementation of BFT enables it to
tolerate a significant portion of malicious nodes while maintaining consensus
integrity <a href="https://github.com/cometbft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CometBFT, 2023</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: CometBFT is known for meeting low-latency (T) and
high-throughput (V) demands of systems like Orcfax and can accommodate up to 180
nodes within a network(<a href="https://hub.cosmos.network/main/validators/overview#introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Validator Overview</a>). With an optimized structure
for block finality, CometBFT can handle moderate to high transaction rates while
maintaining stability. This combination of efficiency and network size aligns
well with Orcfax’s core requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong>: CometBFT’s BFT consensus model provides robustness against
adversarial conditions, enabling it to handle environments where up to one-third
of nodes may act maliciously <a href="https://github.com/cometbft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CometBFT, 2023</a>. This level of fault
tolerance is crucial for decentralized oracle services, where data integrity and
resistance to malicious actors are paramount. CometBFT’s resilience aligns with
Orcfax’s requirements for security and reliability.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong>: Integrating CometBFT with Orcfax may require adapting its block
proposal and voting structure to align with the data validation and consensus
needs of Orcfax. These adaptations are feasible within CometBFT’s flexible
design, but careful configuration would be necessary to optimize performance
within Orcfax’s real-time data processing framework.</p>

<p>An implementation of CometBFT by Orcfax could provide future opportunities to
leverage Cardano native tooling. The Cardano Foundation is developing
Cardano-IBC as a framework for enabling Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) on
the Cardano blockchain; Cardano-IBC focuses on creating secure, cross-chain
interactions, specifically aiming for interoperability with ecosystems like
Cosmos, which uses IBC protocols for secure cross-chain data and asset transfers
<a href="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-ibc-incubator/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardano Foundation, 2023</a>.</p>
<p>IBC&#x27;s claims regarding its capability of enabling efficient data exchange across
networks with low latency, could be useful in the event of a CometBFT
implementation by EchoNet. However, this solution requires further research to
better understand how its implementation would affect an Orcfax implementation
of CometBFT within EchoNet.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="210-vechainthor">2.10 VeChainThor<a href="#210-vechainthor" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.10 VeChainThor" title="Direct link to 2.10 VeChainThor">​</a></h3>
<p>VeChainThor uses Proof of Authority (PoA) for low-latency, high-throughput
transaction finality, primarily in controlled environments <a href="https://docs.vechain.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VeChain, 2023</a>
PoA enables fast transaction processing by relying on a limited number of
trusted validators who are pre-approved, making it more efficient but less
decentralized than PoS or PoW models. VeChainThor’s PoA model is designed for
enterprise applications, such as supply chain tracking, where rapid finality and
controlled validator networks are prioritized over decentralization.</p>
<p>The VeChainThor network achieves consensus through selected validators who have
authority within the network. These validators verify transactions and add
blocks to the chain, enabling near-instant finality and high transaction
throughput <a href="https://docs.vechain.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VeChain, 2023</a>. However, PoA’s reliance on a fixed set of
validators introduces centralization risks, making it less suited for open,
decentralized applications like Orcfax.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="2101-vechainthor-against-requirements">2.10.1 VeChainThor against requirements<a href="#2101-vechainthor-against-requirements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.10.1 VeChainThor against requirements" title="Direct link to 2.10.1 VeChainThor against requirements">​</a></h4>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: VeChainThor’s PoA model enables rapid transaction processing,
allowing the network to handle high transaction volumes with minimal latency.
This efficiency aligns with Orcfax’s low-latency requirements but falls short in
scalability within a highly decentralized environment, as PoA’s performance
depends on a restricted number of trusted validators. Therefore, while
VeChainThor could meet Orcfax’s throughput and latency requirements, its
structure limits scalability and broader decentralization <a href="https://docs.vechain.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VeChain, 2023</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong>: PoA provides reliability through a fixed set of known
validators, reducing the risk of malicious actors in a controlled environment.
However, for a decentralized oracle, this model is less robust, as it lacks
byzantine fault tolerance and is vulnerable if the trusted validators become
compromised. For Orcfax, which requires resilience against adversarial behavior,
VeChainThor’s PoA may not provide the required reliability in an open network
setting <a href="https://docs.vechain.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VeChain, 2023</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong>: VeChainThor faces numerous challenges for implementation by
Orcfax. Adapting VeChainThor’s PoA model to Orcfax’s requirements could involve
significant modification of validator selection and consensus structure.</p>

<p>Based on the analysis of each consensus protocol and the initial Must Have
requirements identified by Orcfax, none of the reviewed consensus protocols
fully meets all of Orcfax&#x27;s needs out-of-the-box. The most protocol that seems
to best align with the requirements is Cosmos&#x27;s CometBFT. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity-(ish). Limiting the participants to 180 nodes allowed
Cosmos/CometBFT to be simpler, than some of the alternatives. EchoNet is
targeting only 100 nodes.</li>
<li>Built as SDK. What for other solutions maybe considered &quot;internal APIs&quot;, are
external for CometBFT. This means the code and the ideas behind the code are
much more accessible.</li>
<li>Synergies. The development of the IBC by the Cardano Foundation provides a
hope that there will be other tooling that we can take advantage of and
contribute to.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="41-limitations">4.1 Limitations<a href="#41-limitations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4.1 Limitations" title="Direct link to 4.1 Limitations">​</a></h3>
<p>As stated at the outset, this paper did not attempt to cover the breadth of
consensus protocols which have been deployed across the numerous blockchain
networks active at the time of its writing. Instead, a limited sample of
consensus protocols used by PoS blockchains were was selected.</p>
<p>Additionally, the analysis of each of the selected protocols was premised on the
documentation readily accessible through each of the blockchain networks&#x27; public
facing sites.</p>

<p>After assessing the limited sample set of consensus protocols against an initial
understanding of Orcfax network requirements for EchoNet, several key takeaways
became clear.</p>
<p>The most interesting lines of inquiry are with the CometBFT implementation of
the Cosmos consensus protocol.</p>
<ul>
<li>CometBFT meets requirements on node count; it demonstrably handles at least
180 nodes which is more than enough as EchoNet will accommodate 100
Validators with licenses.</li>
<li>Finality is faster than Ouroboros and exceeds our current understanding of
EchoNet requirements.</li>
<li>The tooling lacks the significant complexity that would impair an Orcfax
implementation of another solution; this makes CometBFT a much more feasible
starting point given time constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>An Orcfax implementation of a Cosmos consensus solution could make future
Cardano-IBC tooling from the Cardano Foundation available and relevant to
EchoNet design.</p>
<p>Additional research and analysis is needed to further appreciate the interplay
between the implementation of a consensus protocol by Orcfax and its staking
mechanism.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/project-catalyst/f12-economic-model"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">EchoNet: considerations for the economy of a decentralized network</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/project-catalyst/wallis-koch--2024--a-comparative-analysis-staking"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">A Comparative Analysis of Staking Protocols in Blockchain Networks</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#abstract" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Abstract</a></li><li><a href="#1-introduction" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">1.
