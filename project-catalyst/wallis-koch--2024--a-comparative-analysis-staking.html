<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="abstract">Abstract<a href="#abstract" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Abstract" title="Direct link to Abstract">​</a></h2>
<p>This paper provides a brief comparison of various staking protocols across
different blockchain networks and an assessment of each against an initial
understanding of system requirements identified by Orcfax, which seeks to
ascertain whether an existing solution, as a drop in solution for Orcfax,
adequately meets its needs. However, it was found that no single staking
protocol from the sample set fully meets all requirements outlined in the Orcfax
Staking Protocol Requirements; each protocol was found to have its strengths,
but they collectively fall short of the preliminary system requirements in one
or more critical areas.</p>
<p>While there are a multitude of staking protocols in operation, this paper has
analyzed a limited sample which is meant to be representative; included in this
assessment are the staking protocols utilized by: Algorand, Avalanche, Bitcoin
Lightning, Cardano, Cosmos, and Ethereum. Each protocol&#x27;s mechanism for staking,
rewards, and penalties are examined in light of Orcfax priorities for network
security, equitable participation, and long term decentralization in order to
better understand each protocol&#x27;s features and the implications of use for
Orcfax participants.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-staking">What is staking<a href="#what-is-staking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is staking" title="Direct link to What is staking">​</a></h3>
<p>In the context of blockchains and crypto currency, the original use of the term
&quot;staking&quot; is credited to <a href="https://www.peercoin.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peercoin</a>. Peercoin introduced a Proof of stake
consensus protocol as an alternative to Bitcoin&#x27;s proof of work. The protocol
requires those participating in consensus to &#x27;lock up&#x27; their native currency
PPC. By doing so, the likelihood of a participant having the ability to mint the
next block is determined by the relative &#x27;coin age&#x27; of their stake. Coin age
being determined by the length of time those assets had been locked.</p>
<p>The authors of the protocol claim that this mechanism is too expensive to be
abused for an attackers financial advantage.</p>
<p>Since Peercoin&#x27;s inception, the term &#x27;staking&#x27; has been used by many different
protocols to describe mechanisms in their own protocol that share some
characteristics with that of Peercoin. However, there is significant divergence
in what these mechanisms are to the extent that they have overlap. For example,
staking on Cardano refers to participants using their funds to aid the health of
the network (like Peercoin), but it is delegated and not locked (unlike
Peercoin). In contrast, staking on Ethereum 2.0 is done only by those actively
participating in consensus, and this stake is locked and slashable.</p>
<p>In further contrast, the term is also employed when only referring to assets
being &#x27;locked&#x27;, and not always when related to participation.</p>

<p>While the previous section illustrates how the term &quot;staking&quot; has been used
inconsistently after its inception, Orcfax takes staking to mean:</p>
<p>The &#x27;financial&#x27; incentive structure aimed at encouraging good and/or
discouraging bad behaviour of the participants of a decentralised network. The
ultimate goal of staking being to ensure the network remains active in a
sustainable way.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-orcfax-and-what-is-its-need-for-staking">What is Orcfax and what is its need for staking?<a href="#what-is-orcfax-and-what-is-its-need-for-staking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Orcfax and what is its need for staking?" title="Direct link to What is Orcfax and what is its need for staking?">​</a></h3>
<p>Orcfax is an aspiring decentralized oracle protocol built on top of Cardano. As
Orcfax prepares to transition to a fully decentralized service provider, it will
begin by distributing oracle tasks across a network of node operators. The
collection of these participants providing oracle services form a decentralized
network. These participants must produce &#x27;statements&#x27; for those whose protocols
require the consumption of oracle data (i.e. consumers).</p>
<p>An important feature of this network will be the use of staking. Orcfax wishes
to construct a staking mechanism that aids its long term health, and inspires
confidence in their consumers that statements will be accurately and promptly
produced now and into the future.</p>
<p>By nature of being an oracle, much of the Orcfax protocol does not and cannot
operate within the context of a blockchain. The staking mechanism implemented
must reflect this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the participants of the service provision must be holders of an NFT
token series on Cardano, the Orcfax Validator Licenses. There are 100 of these
licenses.</p>
<p>Orcfax will require participants to maintain a specified stake and be holders of
one Orcfax Validator License NFT, of which there are 100, in order to prove
their &quot;skin in the game&quot; and to participate in oracle related tasks. Should
operators perform as desired, they will be rewarded proportionate to their
performance. If operators perform in undesirable ways, some staking protocols
utilize &quot;slashing&quot; as a punishment whereby some, or all, of the staked assets
may be removed from the participant. However, care must be taken; the wrong
incentive structure may either: cause a race to the top, where rewards only go
to a few participants which eventually leads to centralization; or, cause a race
to the bottom, where participants are rewarded even if they are poor service
providers. Both of which are bad for the long term health of the service.</p>
<p>As the integration of any staking mechanism will dramatically affect how
operators participate within the network, it is imperative that Orcfax
understands the implications of staking mechanism design choices. As such, this
paper seeks to understand the current state of staking protocols across
blockchain networks and whether any may be of use to Orcfax. This paper uses a
qualitative research method and has primarily used the publicly available
documentation and publications provided by each protocol.</p>

<p>In order to develop a critical framework by which staking mechanism could be
compared, Orcfax combined a preliminary vision for the mechanism, a draft set of
system requirements, and participant requirements. The combination of these
serve the sole purpose of providing Orcfax with a foundation and structure by
which the sample set could be assessed.</p>
<p>Additionally, each staking mechanism is examined in light of Orcfax priorities
for network security, the degree of or opportunity for equitable participation,
and how each might contribute to the long term decentralization goals of the
Orcfax network.</p>
<p>The Orcfax staking protocol should operate within a decentralized service
framework, where participants, both competent and potentially malicious, must
work together to provide reliable service. The system&#x27;s design must seek to
emphasize the incentivization of good behavior and penalization of bad actions
through its staking mechanism.</p>

Overview of staking Protocols">​</a></h2>
<p>While this paper does not cover the breadth of staking protocols being used
across the multitude of blockchain networks, care was taken to select protocols
which together are representative of the different methods for implementing
staking. The following protocols are discussed in alphabetical order: Algorand,
Avalanche, Bitcoin Lightning, Cardano, Cosmos, and Ethereum.</p>
<p>These protocols have been assessed against the requirements outlined in the
&quot;Orcfax staking protocol requirements&quot; and in light of Orcfax priorities for
network security, equitable participation, and long term goals for
decentralization.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="31-algorand">3.1 Algorand<a href="#31-algorand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.1 Algorand" title="Direct link to 3.1 Algorand">​</a></h3>
<p>Algorand is a proof-of-stake blockchain that requires users to hold its native
token, Algo, to participate within the network. The minimum stake to participate
is effectively 1 Algo. This staking mechanism is notable in that it allows users
to retain control of their staked Algo even while participating in consensus.
However, participation does not yield rewards currently, which raises concerns
about user incentives to run nodes. In addition to the absence of rewards, there
are not yet any penalties for bad behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Participation in consensus currently does not affect the proportion of
participation rewards an account receives. Participation rewards are based on
the amount of stake an account has, irrespective of whether the account is
marked online or offline. Furthermore, currently there are no participation
rewards on MainNet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/participate/#online-participation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p>
<p>While there is no minimum threshold, the probability in actively participating
is proportional to the stake, which is not locked and is not slashable.</p>
<p>The protocol has some limited support for rewards. However it is currently not
utilised - rewards are effectively set to 0.</p>
<p>The architects of Algorand have raised concerns about the levels of
participation in consensus. Moreover, there is a suggestion that lack of rewards
contributes to the problem. The following quote is taken from <em>Algorand
Consensus Incentivisation: An Algorand foundation discussion paper</em> (Woods,
Treccani, Jannotti, 2023).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Algorand’s original thesis contended, a priori, that a sufficient number of
end-users would naturally be incentivised to run a node and contribute to
online stake, motivated by the desire to secure their own funds, and as a
corollary the network. However, a posteriori, it has been observed that as a
consequence of the cost to run a participation node with high uptime, and
indeed the technical expertise required to both instantiate and maintain a
node, a critical mass of end-user contribution has not been reached.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://26119259.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/26119259/Website-2024/PDFs/Algorand%20-%20Consensus%20Incentivisation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p>
<p>Given the above, an assessment of Algorand <a href="https://developer.algorand.org/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> against Orcfax
system requirements results in the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Algorand employs a consensus mechanism with the aim to enhance
network security without compromising decentralization, however it does not
currently employ an incentive structure to promote goof behavior or
disincentives to discourage bad behavior; our limited research did not reveal
whether this posed a potential security risk for the network.</li>
<li><strong>Participation:</strong> The lack of rewards for participation on the mainnet may
result in low engagement. While the staking mechanism allows users to
maintain control over their funds during staking, the absence of incentives
may hinder broader participation.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Algorand’s model promotes decentralization by allowing
all holders of Algo to participate in consensus. However, the technical
complexity and costs associated with maintaining high uptime for nodes
without an incentive to do so may discourage potential validators, leading to
centralization risks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taken together, the staking protocol used by Alogrand as a drop in solution for
Orcfax partially meets the requirements, particularly in security and
decentralization, but falls short in providing effective incentives for
participation, which is crucial for a robust staking ecosystem. An additional
strength of the protocol is its emphasis on accessibility; Algorand allows any
user to participate in securing the network by allowing any holder of Algo (of
any amount) to participate and users maintain control of their assets at all
times, making it user-friendly for those in diverse financial situations and for
those who prefer non-custodial solutions.</p>
<p>However, the absence of participation rewards is assessed as a design weakness
and one which if incorporated into an Orcfax solution could lead to low user
motivation to run participation nodes. This is a significant gap in meeting the
requirement for robust incentives. Additionally, the lack of penalties for bad
behavior is assessed as a risk which may reduce the overall security of the
network as there is no deterrent against malicious activity.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="32-avalanche">3.2 Avalanche<a href="#32-avalanche" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.2 Avalanche" title="Direct link to 3.2 Avalanche">​</a></h3>
<p>Avalanche is a PoS blockchain which employs a validation mechanism where
participants must stake AVAX tokens in order to validate transactions. A minimum
stake of 2,000 AVAX is required to participate on mainnet while 1 AVAX is
required to participate on their testnet (Fuji); when it comes to participation,
validators are sampled for consensus based on the proportion of their stake,
which means that participants may be incentivized to increase their stake.</p>
<p>While the minimum stake could prove a challenge to entry, the network justifies
it as a security feature.</p>
<p>&quot;To resist sybil attacks, a decentralized network must require that network
influence is paid with a scarce resource. This makes it infeasibly expensive for
an attacker to gain enough influence over the network to compromise its
security.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.avax.network/nodes/validate/what-is-staking#:~:text=To%20resist%20sybil%20attacks%2C%20a%20decentralized%20network%20must%20require%20that%20network%20influence%20is%20paid%20with%20a%20scarce%20resource.%20This%20makes%20it%20infeasibly%20expensive%20for%20an%20attacker%20to%20gain%20enough%20influence%20over%20the%20network%20to%20compromise%20its%20security." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p>
<p>Avalanche also enables holders to delegate their AVAX to validators; a
validator&#x27;s influence therefore is increased not only by their own stake above
the minimum, but may be increased through delegation up to a maximum of 3
million AVAX. This ability to delegate to validators enables holders to assist
in securing the network, receive rewards for their delegations, and do so
without the overhead of being their own validator. However, delegators are
required to hold a minimum of 25 AVAX on mainnet in order to delegate.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.avax.network/nodes/validate/validate-vs-delegate#:~:text=To%20delegate%20on%20the%20Avalanche%20network%2C%20a%20minimum%20of%2025%20AVAX%20tokens%20is%20required%20on%20the%20Mainnet%20(1%20AVAX%20on%20the%20Fuji%20Testnet)." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p>
<p>Participation as a validator is incentivized by rewarding uptime. Validators are
eligible for rewards for their efforts securing the network, which is measured
through the total time their node is active and participating within the
network. Through random sampling executed by their peers, a validator&#x27;s node
must be found to be active or responsive more than 80% of any given validation
period.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.avax.network/nodes/validate/how-to-stake#:~:text=A%20validator%20will%20receive%20a%20staking%20reward%20if%20they%20are%20online%20and%20response%20for%20more%20than%2080%25%20of%20their%20validation%20period%2C%20as%20measured%20by%20a%20majority%20of%20validators%2C%20weighted%20by%20stake.%20You%20should%20aim%20for%20your%20validator%20be%20online%20and%20responsive%20100%25%20of%20the%20time." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p>
<p>With that said, there are no penalties or slashing for bad behavior committed by
validators. The only risk that participants face is becoming ineligible for
rewards by failing to meet specified parameters.</p>
<p>Given the above, an assessment of the Avalanche <a href="https://docs.avax.network/nodes/validate/what-is-staking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> against
Orcfax system requirements results in the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Avalanche’s high minimum stake threshold for participation and
incentive structure through random sampling of validator node uptime promotes
security of the network and may enhance resilience against attacks. And while
this aspect of the model aligns well with the Orcfax requirement for a secure
staking environment, the absence of penalties leaves something to be desired.</li>
<li><strong>Participation:</strong> Broad participation as a validator may be limited by a
minimum stake which could be perceived as a high cost to entry; Avalanche may
have tempered this criticism by enabling the option for delegation, which
thereby allows users with smaller stakes to engage without needing to run a
full node.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> The difference between the minimum stake for validators
(2,000 AVAX), the maximum combined stake and delegation (2m AVAX), and
weighted validator influence mechanic may pose centralization risks if
reaching the maximum is competitive and results in a few validators holding
increased influence over the network. Conversely, the delegation feature may
help to mitigate this risk by allowing a more distributed participation
model.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taken together, the staking protocol used by Avalanche as a drop in solution for
Orcfax partially meets the requirements regarding security and incentives for
participation; the simplification of incentivizing uptime conveys a clear reward
structure based on the amount staked, which may effectively motivating users to
participate actively. The lack of penalties or slashing is notable. While
limiting the scope of the incentive structure to whether a node is eligible or
ineligible may not sufficiently deter negligence or bad behavior.</p>
<p>Additionally, security as a strength appears to come at the cost of
participation; the minimum stake to participate in the network may prevent broad
participation from holders, although it is acknowledged that enabling delegation
may work to address this shortcoming. With that said, care may need to be taken
to deter potential centralization risks.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="33-bitcoin-lightning">3.3 Bitcoin Lightning<a href="#33-bitcoin-lightning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.3 Bitcoin Lightning" title="Direct link to 3.3 Bitcoin Lightning">​</a></h3>
<p>As a layer-2 solution on Bitcoin, the Lightning Network is comprised of
bidirectional payment channels between participants which facilitate off-chain
transactions. In this system Bitcoin is locked in order to open an LN payment
channel. LN, in its original conception, the network introduced an incentive
structure whereby users locked funds as stake in the sense that if one
participant of a channel were to behave badly in a provable way, the other
participant of the channel would be able to take the locked stake.</p>
<p>However, more recent iterations (e.g. eltoo aka LN-symmetry) have opted to
remove this penalty centric incentive structure on the grounds that it
complicates the design, and can result in unintentional penalties for
participants.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eltoo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p>
<p>Given the above, an assessment of the Bitcoin Lightning <a href="https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a> against
Orcfax system requirements results in the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> The Lightning Network’s design inherently deters malicious
behavior through the risk of losing locked funds. However, the current
penalty system may require careful enforcement to maintain trust among
participants.</li>
<li><strong>Participation:</strong> The LN&#x27;s unique model allows for rapid transactions
between participants, however, the complexity of managing channels and the
potential for penalties could deter participation.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> As a layer two solution, the LN depends on the
underlying network for security. This dependency can lead to varying levels
of decentralization.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taken together, the staking protocol used by Bitcoin lighting as a drop in
solution for Orcfax partially meets the requirements. While it offers a secure
and innovative model for transaction processing which inherently deters
malicious behavior through the risk of lost stake and thereby creates a strong
disincentive for dishonest actions within payment channels, the complexities and
potential penalties involved may limit broader participation. Additionally,
while efforts have been made to create iterations which remove penalties, this
may undermine the incentive for participants to maintain honest behavior, which
is a critical requirement for staking protocols.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="34-cardano">3.4 Cardano<a href="#34-cardano" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.4 Cardano" title="Direct link to 3.4 Cardano">​</a></h3>
<p>Cardano is another prominent proof-of-stake blockchain utilizing its native
token, ADA. Stake pool operators (SPOs) are block producers and are required to
stake 500 ADA in order to operate their nodes. SPO&#x27;s are incentivized to
participate through block producing rewards, and there are no penalties or
slashing for bad behavior.</p>
<p>Holders have the ability to delegate their ADA to these SPOs and may be rewarded
by doing so; the ADA which these users delegate is not locked and is not
slashable. The likelihood of any given node producing a block is, in part,
determined by the amount of stake and volume of delegation attributed to it. A
block producing node receives rewards for their services in securing the
network. Generally some of the awards received by the SPO&#x27;s are ultimately
shared with those who delegated to the pool, but each SPO can adjust whether,
and to what degree, this is done.</p>
<p>Given the above, an assessment of the Cardano <a href="https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/learn/stake-pools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> against
Orcfax system requirements results in the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> The design of Cardano’s Ouroboros consensus algorithm
incentivizes SPOs to actively participate in block production. However, the
absence of slashing penalties is noteworthy as there does not appear to be an
effective way of disincentivizing malicious behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Participation:</strong> The stake and delegation model encourages increased user
participation by allowing non-SPOs delegators to earn rewards without needing
technical expertise. The competitive nature of stake pools promotes active
engagement, which meets the Orcfax requirement for incentivized
participation.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> By setting the minimum stake for SPO&#x27;s relatively low
and by allowing other holders to leverage their ADA through its delegation
system Cardano prioritizes decentralization of network participation through
user choices in terms of where they delegate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taken together, the staking protocol used by Cardano as a drop in solution for
Orcfax effectively meets the requirements across incentives, and
decentralization, positioning itself as a strong contender in the staking
landscape. The ability for users to delegate without locking funds encourages
broad participation while the competitive nature of those delegations may
influence SPO performance in order to maintain them.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="35-cosmos">3.5 Cosmos<a href="#35-cosmos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.5 Cosmos" title="Direct link to 3.5 Cosmos">​</a></h3>
<p>Cosmos facilitates a network of interconnected blockchains, utilizing the PoS
Tendermint consensus mechanism and its native currency ATOM; with that said, the
current fork that is used is &quot;CometBFT&quot;, which notably is a BFT based algorithm.</p>
<p>Any holder of ATOM may either declare their intention of becoming a Validators,
or choose to delegate their ATOM to one of these validators in order to earn
rewards. For those seeking to become validators, the total number of active
validators on the network is limited. At the time of this writing, the total
number of validators is limited to 180, but this number can be adjusted through
governance protocols; in order to secure the ability to operate as a validator
and participate in the network by committing blocks, validators must compete for
the highest volume of total stake &amp; delegations; those with volumes in the top
180 are then designated validators.</p>
<p><a href="https://hub.cosmos.network/main/validators/validator-faq.html#becoming-a-validator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p>
<p>Notably, the stake and delegations are locked and can be slashed. The following
is an excerpt from their whitepaper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Validators in Cosmos have a similar role to Bitcoin miners, but instead use
cryptographic signatures to vote. Validators ... are responsible for
committing blocks. Non-validators can delegate their staking tokens (called
&quot;atoms&quot;) to any validator to earn a portion of block fees and atom rewards,
but they incur the risk of getting punished (slashed) if the delegate
validator gets hacked or violates the protocol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://v1.cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper#:~:text=Validators%20in%20Cosmos,and%20light%20clients." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p>
<p>This is similar to Cardano, in that users can delegate to dedicated validators,
and then take a share of rewards. However, a key distinction in Cosmos is that
(non-validator) users may also <em>lose</em> their stake if the validator behaves
badly. This dual structure incentivizes users to choose reliable validators to
mitigate their risk of slashing, and the competitive nature of delegation, in
order for validators to maintain their privileges, may work to further
incentivize good behavior on the part of the validator.</p>
<p>Cosmos&#x27;s focus on interchain interoperability appears to necessitate a focus on
bridges. Whereby Participants validating txs across a bridge are <em>bridge-zone
validators</em>. However, the details of this role are not fleshed out in the
original whitepaper; the whitepaper says only that validators should stake
collateral to be forfeit in the event of bad behavior in order to disincentivize
it.</p>
<p>Given the above, an assessment of Cosmos <a href="https://hub.cosmos.network/main/validators/validator-faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> against Orcfax
system requirements results in the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> The high minimum stake threshold for participation, that
inevitably occurs through the competitive nature of maintaining the role of a
validator, combined with the Cosmos incentive structure promotes security of
the network and may enhance resilience against attacks. This aspect of the
model aligns well with the Orcfax requirement for a secure staking
environment and includes slashing as a penalty for bad behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Participation:</strong> The absence of an explicit minimum stake threshold for
validators may have broadened participation early on, but the competitive
nature of maintaining a large total volume of both stake and delegations my
create barriers for entry as the network grows. However, the incentives for
holders to delegate their ATOM and receive rewards allows for multiple
avenues for users to participate in securing the network. It is unclear
whether the risks related to slashing deter broader participation in
delegation.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Cosmos promotes decentralization through its
multi-chain architecture, allowing various independent blockchains to
interact. However, the competitive nature of securing total stake and
delegation volume in order to provide collateral for cross-chain transactions
could result in a centralization risk if few participants ran many nodes.
Possibly as a response to this criticism, Cosmos does have the ability to
increase the total number of validators through governance actions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taken together, the staking protocol used by Cosmos as a drop in solution for
Orcfax meets several requirements but faces challenges related to its incentive
structure and potential centralization risks. While Orcfax has identified
slashing as a requirement in order to disincentivize malicious behavior, we had
not considered slashing non-validator delegations. Additionally, the absence of
a maximum stake and delegation volume combined with the need for validators to
compete in securing delegation volumes, while potentially adding to an incentive
structure, may provide a centralization risk. It would be essential for Orcfax
to address these issues prior to implementation in order to align with its
requirements and to strengthen its own network.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="36-ethereum">3.6 Ethereum<a href="#36-ethereum" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.6 Ethereum" title="Direct link to 3.6 Ethereum">​</a></h3>
<p>Ethereum is the largest blockchain based on total value locked (TVL) and has
recently transitioned away from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to its
current PoS mechanism. Those looking to participate in securing the network must
stake a minimum of 32 ETH to become validators; And while non-validator holders
do not have the ability to delegate to validators for a share in rewards, as
some of the other chains in this paper allow, participants have multiple methods
by which they may operate validator nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>as an independent (i.e. Home staking)</li>
<li>by leveraging cloud compute (i.e. Staking as a Service)</li>
<li>by pooling (which allows multiple holders to mutually participate)</li>
<li>or by staking through a CEX (i.e. Centralized Exchange)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/staking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p>
<p>And each of these methods varies in terms of expected rewards for the
participant.</p>
<p>Ethereum has deployed an incentive structure in order to reward participants for
helping in securing the network. Rewards are given for actions that help the
network reach consensus. Validators may receive rewards for running software
that properly batches transactions into new blocks, and when they check the work
of other validators.</p>
<p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/staking/#:~:text=Rewards%20are%20given,consensus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p>
<p>The Ethereum FAQ page suggests that because these tasks are constantly being
executed, validators are essentially incentivized for their uptime and that
validators may expect their services to be net profitable so long as the
validator&#x27;s uptime is greater than 50%.</p>
<p><a href="https://holesky.launchpad.ethereum.org/en/faq#responsibilities:~:text=expect%20your%20validator%20to%20be%20net%20profitable%20as%20long%20as%20your%20uptime%20is%20greater%20than%2050%25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p>
<p>But the Ethereum incentive structure isn&#x27;t limited to just incentives, the
staking protocol also utilizes penalties or slashing for bad behavior. Ethereum
defines slashing as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slashing has two purposes: (1) to make it prohibitively expensive to attack
the network, and (2) to stop validators from being lazy by checking that they
actually perform their duties. If you&#x27;re slashed because you&#x27;ve acted in a
provably destructive manner, a portion of your stake will be destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/01/13/validated-staking-on-eth2-1-incentives" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p>
<p>Accordingly, being offline for brief periods of time results in small inactivity
penalties to accrue against validators, however, validators may annul these
penalties through uptime. With that said, Ethereum adjusts these penalties based
on how many validators are operating, with more severe penalties being executed
when large number sof validators are down at the same time.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s important to note that the minimum amount that is slashed is 1 ETH and that
validators may not participate so long as their stake is below the required 32
ETH.</p>
<p>Given the above, an assessment of the Ethereum <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/staking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> against
Orcfax system requirements results in the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake model enhances
security through its rigorous validator requirements and slashing penalties
for malicious behavior. This approach aligns well with the need for a secure
staking protocol.</li>
<li><strong>Participation:</strong> The varied staking options—solo, pooled, and
staking-as-a-service—provide flexibility for users, catering to different
technical expertise levels. However, the requirement for 32 ETH to become a
solo validator may limit participation for smaller holders, creating a
barrier to entry.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Ethereum&#x27;s reliance on slashing penalties aims to
promote accountability among validators. However, the complexity of its
staking mechanism could inadvertently favor larger participants, posing risks
to decentralization.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taken together, the staking protocol used by Ethereum as a drop in solution for
Orcfax generally meets the requirements, particularly in security and
participation incentives, but falls short when it comes to methods for
participation, barriers to entry, and the resulting potential centralization;
the requirement of 32 ETH, at its current pricing, may exclude smaller holders
from direct participation, although pooled staking options exist. Regarding the
incentive structure, the ability for validators to both earn rewards for good
behavior and face slashing penalties for malicious actions or prolonged
inactivity, making it a high-stakes environment, aligns with Orcfax
requirements.</p>

provide unique approaches to user incentives without penalties, but the lack of
disincentive for malicious behavior could be seen as a network security risk.</p>

<p>Owing to the mixed use of penalties or a slashing mechanism in the staking
mechanisms reviewed, it is not clear whether the presence or absence of slashing
significantly impacts network security. Ethereum and Cosmos employ slashing to
deter malicious actions, whereas Avalanche, Algorand, and cardano have more
lenient approaches. Bitcoin Lightning’s penalty mechanism depends on channel
disputes but could be quite severe; however, this penalty mechanism may evolve
in future iterations or be removed entirely.</p>

<p>Protocols requiring higher stakes, like Ethereum and Avalanche may encourage
good behavior from participants but doing so creates barriers to entry which
restricts participation. In contrast, Cardano&#x27;s low minimum stake and flexible
delegation withdrawal policies may attract more participants.</p>

<p>This comparative analysis highlights the diverse approaches to staking across
different blockchain protocols. Each mechanism&#x27;s design choices reflect the
underlying philosophy of its network, influencing user participation, network
security, and overall decentralization. As Orcfax seeks to solve its own need
for a staking mechanism, understanding these distinctions and how these design
choices affect key design goals will be crucial for network success.</p>
<p>From the staking protocols reviewed, each exhibited unique strengths and
weaknesses when measured against the Orcfax Staking Protocol Requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Algorand and Avalanche</strong> struggle with incentives and security, limiting
their appeal and robustness.</li>
<li><strong>Bitcoin Lightning&#x27;s</strong> complexity and potential removal of penalties may
hinder user engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Cardano and Cosmos</strong> offer accessible models but vary in terms of risk,
particularly regarding slashing.</li>
<li><strong>Ethereum&#x27;s</strong> comprehensive incentive and security structure are
commendable, though its high entry barrier remains a concern.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, the protocol used by Orcfax must balance accessibility, security,
and incentives to meet the evolving needs of staking participants.</p>

<p>As stated at the outset, this paper did not attempt to cover the breadth of
staking protocols which have been deployed across the numerous blockchain
networks active at the time of its writing. Instead, a limited sample was
selected which was meant to be representative.</p>
<p>Additionally, the analysis of each of the selected proposals was premised on the
documentation and publications readily accessible through each of the blockchain
networks&#x27; public facing sites.</p>
<p>Further research into the differences, advantages, or downsides to each
protocol&#x27;s staking mechanism could be furthered by the incorporation of
alternative research methods such as the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Empirical Analysis<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Data Collection: Gather real-time data on staking rewards, participation
rates, and network performance for each protocol. This would involve
monitoring blockchain explorers and staking analytics platforms.</li>
<li>User Surveys: Conduct surveys or interviews with users of different
protocols to understand their experiences, challenges, and motivations for
participating in staking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Case Studies<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>In-Depth Case Studies: Choose specific projects or use cases within each
protocol and analyze their staking dynamics. For example, examining how
different stake pools operate in Cardano or how delegation works in
Avalanche.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Comparative Metrics Development<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Develop KPIs to quantitatively compare
protocols. This could include metrics like average staking rewards,
decentralization levels, network uptime, and the impact of slashing on
validators.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="52-key-observations">5.2 Key observations<a href="#52-key-observations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5.2 Key observations" title="Direct link to 5.2 Key observations">​</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Incentives</strong>: While protocols like <strong>Cardano</strong> and <strong>Avalanche</strong> offer
rewarding systems, they lack robust mechanisms that ensure active
participation and engagement, particularly when compared to Ethereum’s strict
penalties for negligence.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Protocols like <strong>Ethereum</strong> provide strong security through
slashing, but this comes at the cost of accessibility, as the entry barrier
is quite high. Conversely, <strong>Algorand</strong> maintains user control but lacks
penalties, which can undermine its security integrity.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: <strong>Avalanche</strong> has a relatively low minimum stake
requirement, promoting participation. Conversely, <strong>Ethereum</strong>&#x27;s 32 ETH
requirement limits access, making it less inclusive.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Management</strong>: Protocols like <strong>Cosmos</strong> introduce slashing risks that
can deter participants. <strong>Bitcoin Lightning</strong>&#x27;s evolution towards removing
penalties could weaken its trustworthiness and security model.</li>
</ol>

<p>No single staking protocol from the reviewed list fully meets all the
requirements outlined in the Orcfax Staking Protocol Requirements. Each protocol
has its strengths and weaknesses, but they collectively fall short of the
preliminary system requirements and in one or more critical areas relating to
Orcfax priorities.</p>
<p>These results signal some important conclusions. First, that given current
understandings of Orcfax network needs, there is no one staking protocol from
the sample set which can serve as a drop in solution. Second, that given the
discrepancies between Orcfax identified system requirements and the sample set,
Orcfax may need to reassess the system requirements developed at the outset of
this research.</p>
<p>A revision to system requirements could result in closer alignment with a
staking mechanism from the sample set, but this would invariably lead to
compromises which could have profound impacts on one or more of the key areas
(participation, security, decentralization).</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/project-catalyst/wallis-koch--2024--a-comparative-analysis-consensus"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">A Comparative Analysis of Consensus Protocols used in Blockchain Networks</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/oracle-basics"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Oracle basics</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#abstract" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Abstract</a></li><li><a href="#1-introduction" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">1.
