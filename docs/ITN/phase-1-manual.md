# Phase 1 manual

**More info to be provided as we approach this ITN phase.**

## Data collection for CEXes

During this phase, Validators will begin decentralizing the collection function
of the Oracle network. Validators will initially run a limited suite of software
responsible for the collection of data from centralized exchanges which have
been identified as primary sources of information. Validators will then
participate in funneling that data to the Orcfax centralized validator and
publisher.

### Hardware and infrastructure

During this phase of the ITN, the hardware requirements will be minimal to
handle the tasks involved. Participants should expect to meet the following
minimum requirements:

* 2GB of RAM
* A single CPU

Recommended requirements for phase 2 onwards\*:

* 32 GB RAM
* 8 CPU
* 600 GB disk

\* Specs are based on the minimal viable digital ocean servers operated by
Orcfax.

However, participants should anticipate that these requirements will change as
development, and ITN phases, progress. For this reason, participants should
consult our [Hardware Requirements](technical-requirements#hardware) where we
will update the requirements as development progresses.
