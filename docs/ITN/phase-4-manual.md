# Phase 4 manual

**More info to be provided as we approach this ITN phase.**

## Decentralized publication & Mainnet soft launch

The final phase will see all validators with the functional ability to
participate in collection, validation and publication on-chain (when nominated).

During this phase, the consensus mechanism will be expanded so as to select a
quorum of validators with approved data in order to then elect one to publish
their Fact Statement on-chain and be rewarded for it.

After this phase has been tested successfully, we will fully move to Mainnet.
