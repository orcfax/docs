# Phase 2 manual

**More info to be provided as we approach this ITN phase.**

## Incorporating DEX data

Validators will now be able to collect the on-chain data from Cardano DEXes,
which underpin Orcfax CNT feeds, and will do so by leveraging their own instance
of a cardano node.

Validators will continue to send all data to the Orcfax federated validator
and publisher.

### Hardware and infrastructure

During this phase of the ITN, participants should expect to meet the following
minimum requirements\*:

-   32 GB RAM
-   8 CPU
-   600 GB disk

\* Specs are based on the minimal viable digital ocean servers operated by
Orcfax.

<!-- This may need to be removed if we are deleting the node operation page
until post-ITN -->

However, participants should anticipate that these requirements will change as
development, and ITN phases, progress. For this reason, participants should
consult our [Technical Requirements](itn-overview#technical-requirements) where we
will update the requirements as development progresses.

### Software requirements

Starting this phase, participants will be expected to operate more taxing
software (e.g. a Cardano node, Ogmios, etc.).
