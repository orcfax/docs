# Phase 3 manual

**More info to be provided as we approach this ITN phase.**

## Decentralized validator protocol

During this phase, validators will begin decentralizing the validation function
of the Orcfax network by running validator software. However, the publication of
Fact Statements to the blockchain will remain controlled by the Orcfax
federated publisher.

This phase will also see the implementation of a consensus mechanism which will
enable the network to elect a single validator for submitting a verified Fact
Statement to the Orcfax's publisher.
