# Phase 1 manual

**More info to be provided as we approach this ITN phase.**

## Data collection for CEXes

During this phase, validators will begin decentralizing the collection function
of the Orcfax Network. Validators will initially run a limited suite of software
responsible for the collection of data from centralized exchanges which have
been identified as primary sources of information. Validators will then
participate in funneling that data to the Orcfax federated validator and
publisher.

### Hardware and infrastructure

During this phase of the ITN, the hardware requirements will be minimal to
handle the tasks involved. Participants should expect to meet the following
minimum requirements:

* 2GB of RAM
* A single CPU
