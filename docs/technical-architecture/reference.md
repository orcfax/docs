# Fact statement reference
<br/>
Users should not have to trust but should verify. This has driven our system
design which captures and archives the entire Orcfax workflow. From Collection,
to the publication event, the whole data collection process-- including evidence
of the fact statement which got published within a smart contract, along with
the use of it-- all gets bundled into an international standards compliant (ISO)
archival package using bag-it, which is then stored off chain in a decentralized
storage network.<br/>
<br/>
Orcfax, through the practical course of business,  will create a massive
decentralized digital archive of facts, which will have high utility and value
for research, and to inform or train future price action or machine learning
models. Users will be able to search through this archive through the Orcfax
Fact Explorer by leveraging the identifying information that hey have at
hand.<br/>
