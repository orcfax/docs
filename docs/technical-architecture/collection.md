# Data collection

Data collection is another critical breakthrough that Orcfax has introduced. The
Orcfax oracle service collects data about real world events from various primary
sources using a network of nodes. These nodes are run independently and
permissionlessly by anyone that is able to install our open source software and
commit a small amount of $FACT tokens as stake.<br><br>
These Orcfax nodes are initiated through executables made available through the
Orcfax GitHub repo, which will be transitioned to a fully decentralized Git repo
at a later date. These executables will ensure and enforce that every node is
operating the exact same software. Additional safeguards have also been
implemented to prevent tampering with this software in order to mitigate the
risks associated with man in the middle attacks.<br><br>
Orcfax executables are fully open sourced and are visible online along with our
pipeline in order to facilitate user review. We believe that our community
should be able to review a release and follow it down to the command level to
see what new changes were made to the software. Users will be able to review the
pipeline that generated the executable and its signature so that authenticity of
the software release is safeguarded. This will also allow Orcfax to limit
participation within the validator network to those running the appropriately
signed executable. For now, these will be developed by the project, which is
currently Orcfax Ltd. as the corporate entity. However, handing over the
governance of the network, along with long-term maintenance and development, and
transitioning to a decentralized autonomous organization is a long-term priority
of Orcfax and is reflected in our roadmap.<br><br>
First and foremost, at the very front end of collecting data, Orcfax nodes will
triangulate their data collection. What that means is that Orcfax doesn’t rely
on any one or two single sources. Our system requires a minimum of three
separate independent data sources for the same data which can be queried by our
network of decentralized oracle pool nodes.<br><br>
Example
If the target data was the outcome or score of a football match between
Manchester United and Chelsea, Orcfax nodes could hit a sports website and
scrape the results, do the same for a second, and for the third. At the end, the
node has received information regarding the target from three independent
sources.<br><br>
Triangulation of data is a scientific principle that Orcfax has adopted as a
method for developing comprehensive understandings of the phenomena which it
report on; it is a system requirement that each Orcfax feed utilizes a minimum
of three sources (S1, S2, S3, Sn+1) but can accommodate a dynamic number of
sources in order to compensate for type or the need for more sources to achieve
validity. These three sources can comprise of application programming interfaces
(API’s), internet of things (IoT) devices, weather stations, and crowdsourced
reporting data (eg a series of geotagged photographs).
