# Data validation
<br/>
At launch, the Orcfax Federated Network of nodes on mainnet will consist of five
independent participants within our sidechain blockchain of validator nodes.
However, we believe that the success of our incentivized testnet will result in
the rapid adoption of our system by additional participants. Even if node
operators did not participate in our testnet, adoption on mainnet will be aided
in part by the Orcfax staking incentivization model. The goal of Orcfax being,
mass adoption to the point that the system will utilize hundreds of these
independent, geographically and server diverse, nodes.<br/>
<br/>
In order to participate as a validator node, operators will be required to stake
a designated amount of $FACT. In order to drive adoption and equitable access
for participants, the requisite amount of $FACT will be kept relatively low. In
addition to this, the system has been designed not to privilege nodes with stake
above and beyond this set threshold.<br/>
<br/>
Because each node will be implemented using the same software executables, each
node will maintain equivalent technical functionality. What this means in
practice is that each participant will have the exact same technical
specifications, capabilities, and code; each will be capable of executing all
Orcfax processes (e.g. Collection, Validation, Publishing, etc). Importantly,
staking more than the  required $FACT will also not affect a nodeâ€™s chances of
being delegated the responsibility for submitting transactions or increase their
proportional share of pool rewards. These decisions have been made in effort to
positively affect mass-adoption.<br/>
