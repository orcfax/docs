# Technical requirements

While we believe that accessibility plays a large role in decentralization, and
have made design choices which we hope allows a broader range of participation
within the network, it is still important to be aware of what will be required
technically from those who choose to participate. In addition to a validator
license and the minimum $FACT deposit, operators will be expected to be familiar
with:

- The Cardano network
- Operating Linux servers

A full assessment of technical requirements has not yet been completed. This
page will continue to be updated as development continues.

Those interested in the operation of an Orcfax node should join our
[Discord](https://dsc.gg/orcfax) and participate within the channels created for
that purpose.
