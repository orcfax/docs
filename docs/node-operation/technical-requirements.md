# Technical requirements

While we believe that accessibility plays a large role in decentralization, and
have made design choices which we hope allows a broader range of participation
within the network, it is still important to be aware of what will be required
technically from those who choose to participate. In addition to a validator
license and the minimum $FACT deposit, operators will need to meet the following
software and hardware specifications.

NB
A full assessment of technical requirements is ongoing. Therefore, you should
anticipate that this page will change as development progresses.

Those interested in the operation of an Orcfax node should consult the
[ITN Manual](itn-manual) and join our [Discord](https://dsc.gg/orcfax) were
specific channels for operators have been created.

## Software

Operators will be expected to be comfortable with the following:

* Operating Linux servers
* Cardano node software
* Ogmios

## Hardware

The expected hardware specifications required to efficiently run an Orcfax
network node are as follows\*:

* Between 24â€“32 GB RAM
* 8 CPU
* 600 GB disk

\* Specs are based on the minimal viable digital ocean servers operated by
Orcfax.

These specifications are approximate, and participants should be prepared to
scale their hardware setup promptly to meet evolving requirements and ensure
optimal performance.
