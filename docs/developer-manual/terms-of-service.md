# Terms of Service

<!-- To be linked to from `"tos":` -->
*MM DD YYYY*

These terms of service, together with any documents and additional terms they
incorporate by reference (collectively, these “Terms”), are entered into between
Orcfax Ltd. (the “Oracle,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) and you or the company or
other legal entity that you represent (“you” or “your”).

Please read these Terms carefully as they govern your use of our site located at
Orcfax.io and all associated sites (the “Website”) and our Services
(defined below) and describe your rights and obligations and our disclaimers and
limitations of legal liability. By accessing or using any part of the Website or
the Services, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of these
Terms.

If you use the Services on behalf of a company, organization (including a
decentralized autonomous organization or “DAO”) or other entity then “you”
includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant that (a) you are an
authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to
these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf. If you do
not agree to these Terms or do not have authority to bind your organization on
whose behalf you are using the Services to these Terms, you must not access or
use our Website or the Services.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify these Terms from time to
time. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes using
commercially reasonable means, such as by providing a notice through the Website
or our Services or updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless we say
otherwise in our notice, any modifications are effective immediately, and your
continued use of the Website or our Services will confirm your acceptance of the
changes. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using our
Services.

## SERVICES

The Website enables users to access open source documentation, content, and
services, including (without limitation) resources, data and computation
services provided by a network of nodes directly to smart contracts integrating
Orcfax feeds, and information and resources for the community comprising the
Orcfax Network (collectively such services, information, APIs, and resources
related to the Orcfax network are referred to as the “Services”).

## YOUR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; CONDITIONS

You represent and warrant that you: (i) have the necessary technical expertise
and ability to review and evaluate the security, integrity and operation of any
Fact Tokens that you decide to acquire, sell or use; (ii) have the knowledge,
experience, understanding, professional advice and information to make your own
evaluation of the merits, risks and applicable compliance requirements under
Applicable Law of any Fact Token; and (iii) know, understand and accept the
risks associated with your use of the Orcfax Network, your Distributed Ledger
Technology Address, the Distributed Ledger Technology, and Fact Tokens.

The Orcfax Network enables access to data from multiple sources and you
acknowledge and agree that the accuracy, availability or quality of data
provided via the Orcfax Network may be impacted by various factors, including as
a result of the underlying data being volatile or otherwise compromised at the
data source.

## CHANGES; SUSPENSION; TERMINATION

The Orcfax Network is intended to be decentralized and self-operating, with or
without any Services provided by the Oracle. Accordingly, we may, at our sole
discretion, from time to time and with or without prior notice to you, modify,
suspend or disable, temporarily or permanently, the Services offered by the
Oracle, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever, including, but not
limited to, as a result of a security incident, your violation of these Terms
or, in the Oracle’s good faith judgment, such changes, suspension or termination
are necessary for the protection of the Orcfax Network. We will not be liable
for any losses suffered by you resulting from any modification to any Services
or from any suspension or termination, for any reason, of your access to all or
any portion of the Website or the Services. All of these terms will survive any
termination of your access to the Website or the Services, regardless of the
reasons for its expiration or termination, in addition to any other provision
which by law or by its nature should survive.

## INDEMNIFICATION

You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Oracle, our members,
directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers,
licensors and contractors (collectively, Protected Parties”) from any claim,
demand, lawsuit, action, proceeding, investigation, liability, damage, loss,
cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees,
arising out of or relating to your use of, or conduct in connection with, the
Website, Services, the Orcfax Network or Fact Tokens, Distributed Ledger
Technology assets associated with your Distributed Ledger Technology Address,
any other digital assets, any Feedback or User Content; your violation of these
Terms; your violation of Applicable Law or regulations; any claims made by or
against the Protected Parties by other members of the organization or entity on
whose behalf you may be using the Website or Services; or your infringement or
misappropriation of the rights of any other person or entity. If you are
obligated to indemnify any Protected Party, the Oracle (or, at its discretion,
the applicable Protected Party) will have the right, in its sole discretion, to
control any action or proceeding and to determine whether the Oracle wishes to
settle, and if so, on what terms.

## DISCLOSURES; DISCLAIMERS

To the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, the Website and the
Services (and any of their content or functionality) provided by or on behalf of
us are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, and we expressly
disclaim, and you hereby waive, any representations, conditions or warranties of
any kind, whether express or implied, legal, statutory or otherwise, or arising
from statute, otherwise in law, course of dealing, or usage of trade, including,
without limitation, the implied or legal warranties and conditions of
merchantability, merchantable quality, quality or fitness for a particular
purpose, title, security, availability, reliability, accuracy, quiet enjoyment
and non-infringement of third party rights. Without limiting the foregoing, we
do not represent or warrant that the Website or the Services
(including any related data) will be uninterrupted, available at any particular
time or error-free. Further, we do not warrant that errors in the Website or the
Service are correctable or will be corrected.

## EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED DAMAGES

In no event will the Oracle, together with any Protected Party, be liable for
any incidental, indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, consequential or similar
damages or liabilities whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for
loss of data, information, revenue, goodwill, profits or other business or
financial benefit) arising out of or in connection with the Website, the
Services and the Orcfax Network (and any of their content and functionality),
any execution or settlement of a transaction, any performance or non-performance
of the Services, your Distributed Ledger Technology assets, other digital
assets, Fact Tokens or any other product, service or other item provided by or
on behalf of a Protected Party, whether under contract, tort
(including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability, breach of
warranties, or under any other theory of liability, and whether or not any
Protected Party has been advised of, knew of or should have known of the
possibility of such damages and notwithstanding any failure of the essential
purpose of these Terms or any limited remedy nor is the Oracle in any way
responsible for the execution or settlement of transactions between users of
Orcfax software or the Orcfax Network.

## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

In no event will the Protected Parties' aggregate liability arising out of or in
connection with the Website, the Services and the Orcfax Network
(and any of their content and functionality), any performance or non-performance
of the Services, your Distributed Ledger Technology assets, other
digital assets, Fact Tokens or any other product, service or other item provided
by or on behalf of a Protected Party, whether under contract, tort
(including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability or other
theory of liability exceed the amount of fees paid by you to us under these
Terms in the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving
rise to the claim for liability.
