# Terms of service

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->

Valid from: *August 1, 2024*

<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

These Terms of Service, together with any documents and additional terms they
incorporate by reference (collectively, these "Terms"), are entered into between
Orcfax Ltd. ("Orcfax", "we," "us," and "our"), a legal entity registered as a
corporation in the British Virgin Islands and you or the company or
other legal entity that you represent ("you" or "your").

Please read these Terms carefully as they govern your use of the data that
we (1) publish inline to transactions on the Cardano blockchain ("Oracle data"),
(2) data that we archive to the Arweave network ("Archival data") (3) or data
that we publish to the pages and files located at the Internet domain Orcfax.io
(the "Website") and its subdomains such as explorer.orcfax.io or docs.orcfax.io.

## THE SERVICES

Collectively, the Oracle data collected, calculated, validated and published
by Orcfax to transactions on the Cardano blockchain; along with the related
Archival data and files that Orcfax archives to the Arweave network; as well as
the data and information published to the Website (including any and all
sub-domain sites such as the Orcfax Explorer and Docs sites) are hereby referred
to, collectively, as the "Services" provided by Orcfax.

## REVISION OF TERMS OF SERVICE

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify these Terms from time to
time. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes using
Commercially Reasonable Means, which is defined as taking the desired
notification action without a material increase in costs incurred by Orcfax and
the competitive environment in which such action occurs. Examples of such notice
include providing a notice through the Website or updating the date at the top
of these Terms. Unless otherwise stated, any modifications are
effective immediately, and your continued use of Orcfax's Services will confirm
your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you
must stop using our Services.

## YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE

These Terms describe your rights and obligations in relation to the Services and
our disclaimers and limitations of legal liability for the Services. By accessing
or using any part of Orcfax's Oracle data, Archival data or Website data you
agree to become bound by these Terms of Service.

If you use the Services on behalf of a company, organization (including a
decentralized autonomous organization or "DAO") or other entity, or if you
are an automated agent acting on behalf of another entity (including "bots" that
execute actions using artificial intelligence or other technologies for
autonomous decision-making, such as "smart contracts"), then "you" includes you
and that entity. You represent and warrant that (a) you are an authorized
representative of the entity with the authority and agency to bind the entity to
these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity's behalf.

You must not use any of our Services, if you do not agree to these Terms or if
you do not have the authority or agency to bind the entity, on whose behalf you
are using the Services, to these Terms.

## YOUR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; CONDITIONS

Our Services enable access to data from multiple and varied sources. You
acknowledge and agree that the accuracy, availability and quality of data
collected and calculated via our Services may be impacted by various factors,
including as a result of the underlying data being volatile or otherwise
compromised at the data source, which could include malfeance or malpractice.

Some of our Services require holding and paying Distributed Ledger Technology
(DLT) tokens (also known as "crypto-currency") including ADA and FACT. You
hereby represent and warrant that you: (1) have the necessary technical
expertise and ability to review and evaluate the security, integrity and
operation of any tokens that you decide to acquire, sell or use as a result of
using our Services (2) you have the knowledge, experience, understanding,
professional advice and information to make your own evaluation of the merits,
risks and applicable compliance requirements, under Applicable Law, of any ADA
or FACT tokens that are used as inputs or outputs to Orcfax Services; and
(3) know, understand and accept the financial risks associated with your use of
Orcfax Services and any tokens that are used as inputs or outputs to deliver the
Services.

## INDEMNIFICATION

You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Orcfax, our directors, officers,
employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, licensors and
contractors, including those persons and entities operating software that
contributes Oracle data to Orcfax (collectively, the "Protected Parties" or
individually a "Protected Party") from (1) any claim, demand, lawsuit, action,
proceeding, investigation, liability, damage, loss, cost or expense, including
without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or relating to
your use of, or conduct in connection with, Orcfax's Services, including our
Oracle data, Archival data, the Website, ADA and FACT tokens associated with
our or your Distributed Ledger Technology Address; (2) your violation of these
terms; (3) your violation of Applicable Law or regulations; (4) any claims made
by or against the Protected Parties by you or other members of the organization
or entity on whose behalf you may be using the Website or Services; (5) or your
infringement or misappropriation of the rights of any other person or entity. If
you are obligated to indemnify any Protected Party, Orcfax (or, at its
discretion, the applicable Protected Party) will have the right, in its sole
discretion, to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether Orcfax
wishes to settle, and if so, on what terms.

## CHANGES; SUSPENSION; OR TERMINATION OF SERVICES

Orcfax may, at our sole discretion, from time to time and with or without prior
notice to you, modify, suspend or disable, temporarily or permanently, our
offered Services, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever, including, but
not limited to, as a result of demands and preferences communicated by users of
our Services, a security incident, your violation of these Terms or, in the
Orcfax's good faith judgment, such changes, suspension or termination as are
necessary for the protection of our Services.

(including any Oracle data, Archival data, Website data or related data) will
be uninterrupted, available at any particular time or error-free. Further, WE
DO NOT WARRANT THAT ERRORS IN THE SERVICES ARE CORRECTABLE OR WILL BE CORRECTED.

All of these terms will survive any termination of your access to the Services,
regardless of the reasons for its expiration or termination, in addition to any
other provision which by law or by its nature should survive.
