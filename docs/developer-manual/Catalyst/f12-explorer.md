## Problem statement

Users that rely on external oracle data to trigger their DeFi financial
transactions need assurances that it can be trusted, but this information is
difficult for a human to trace and read.

### Proposed solution

The Orcfax Explorer allows users to “trust but verify” the oracle data that
their Cardano dApps use. We will enhance it with visualizations, audit log
downloads, real-time stats and incident reports.

## Milestone 1

Orcfax will develop a dashboard page on the Orcfax Explorer that utilizes highly
informative visualizations to aid users.

## Milestone 2

Orcfax will develop a new feature for the Orcfax Explorer which allows users to
download and read the audit log package for a given fact statement.

## Milestone 3

Orcfax will develop a dashboard page on the Orcfax Explorer that displays
information about Orcfax network activity in real time

## Milestone 4

Orcfax will develop a new Orcfax Explorer feature which notifies users in the
event of a network issue, and provides users with links to incident reports.

## Final Milestone
