# Problem statement

**TLDR; can my dApp trust this real-world data to be authentic and accurate?**

The trillion dollar DeFi industry is critically dependent on real-world data
provided by oracles. However, oracle engineering is still in an early stage.
There are still many opportunities to introduce false data about real-world
events into oracle data collection, validation and publication pipelines.

This is a very lucrative attack vector for bad actors as introducing false
oracle data can trigger large financial payouts from smart contract scripts.
Unfortunately, there are significant challenges to preventing a so-called
“man-in-the-middle” attack and proving that external real-world data introduced
to smart contracts can be trusted to be authentic and accurate.

Collectively, the blockchain industry refers to these challenges as “The Oracle
Problem.”

## Orcfax: a comprehensive [solution](solution-overview)

The oracle problem is not just limited to providing data feeds for DeFi. Society
at large is experiencing a "**[trust crisis](https://medium.com/coinmonks/orcfax-the-trust-machine-revisited-c475dbb0a5d6)**" and needs better solutions
for validating statements of fact about the real world. Orcfax is intentionally
designed to leverage the distributed consensus breakthroughs achieved with
blockchain technology to provide decentralized, "trustless"
fact validation and reference services that will have many applications beyond
DeFi applications. Orcfax is particulary interested in on-demand, real-world
fact validation to counter the threat of AI-generated falsehoods.
