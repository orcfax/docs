# Orcfax architecture

## 1. What are the basic entities in the Orcfax platform?

How will data be gathered and published for the free Mainnet price feeds coming in Q2 2023?

## 1. Which projects has Orcfax partnered with?

We are working closely with the technical and managerial teams of several projects to integrate our Orcfax feeds with exciting and innovative products. Keep an eye on our socials for more formal announcements soon.

## 1. Where can I find the Orcfax team page?

At any one time, the core Orcfax team includes 5-10 staff and contractors. We believe a truly decentralized and permissionless project shouldn't be evaluated based on a very long team list. We've seen enough of that without it being a true indicator of project quality/status. The running code and its open-source codebase, along with its immutable features should be what is getting evaluated. For now, our founder and Peter Van Garderen is the human face behind Orcfax. He has the proven professional qualifications to achieve our project objectives. This includes making Peter obsolete and ensuring Orcfax runs as a fully autonomous network governed by a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

## 1. Will Orcfax be governed by a DAO?

The Orcfax team is committed to radical decentralization and has structured the project accordingly, with the explicit intention of ensuring a 100% hand-off of governance and all aspects of the project to a DAO. 

The Orcfax team will continue to actively engage in Cardano community governance dialogues and model good project behavior in our progression towards full decentralization. Our team shares the personal and professional philosophy that, in the end, our primary objective in this movement is to decentralize power. The Orcfax oracle is just one piece of necessary plumbing infrastructure to facilitate that progression. 

With that said, the decentralization of a project, its community, and technology stack-- especially one as sophisticated as the Orcfax oracle platform-- is not a simple feat and nearly impossible to do correctly from day one. Therefore, we are on a path of gradual decentralization. We will continue to participate in Cardano community discussions about governance to develop our long-game roadmap and milestones towards 100% decentralized, autonomous governance. The likeliest and earliest time for that to happen is by year three, with five years being our maximum threshold deadline for this switch.

## 1. How long has this project been in development?

We have been working on the Orcfax solution since Fall of 2021.
