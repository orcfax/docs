# What is an oracle?
Oracles like [Orcfax](https://orcfax.io/), [Chainlink](https://chain.link),
[Charli3](https://charli3.io), etc. are the technical component in blockchain
architectures that deliver data about the real-world to on-chain smart contracts
.

The name is derived from people in the ancient world who delivered messages and
knowledge from the gods to the mortals.

Software oracles process information from online sources such as website content
and open datasets but mostly from server-based application programming
interfaces (API). These are the most common types of oracles and are used, for
example, by algorithmic stablecoins or automated market maker (AMM) exchanges to
monitor for changes in currency exchange rates.

Hardware oracles collect and publish information from physical sources such as
sensors and barcode scanners. These are found in supply-chain scenarios or earth
data use cases such as tree planting verification.

# Where is the market value?
While other oracles in the Cardano ecosystem have struggled to find projects to
integrate their feeds, there is absolutely no shortage of projects that need
oracle feeds; this disparity is a direct result of customers having difficulty
with the technical architecture choices, pricing model, and off-chain
co-coordination requirements implemented by our competition. In contrast, Orcfax
has been approached by several projects looking to integrate our feeds. We are
currently in private, active conversations with several profile Cardano
projects; while we will not be announcing "partnerships", We are lining up a
number of feed-consumer announcements which we will announce over the coming
months.

# What advantages does Orcfax have over competition?
Orcfax offers several advantages over other oracle solutions. For one, the
Cardano Open Oracle Protocol, which we developed with the help of
[MLabs](https://mlabs.city/), is an elegant solution to oracle publication on
Cardano and promotes a financial sustainability model. There are many other
differences on top of that, especially on how we source and validate data as
well as our focus on archiving authentic audit trails of all the data and
metadata generated by a fact publication workflow.
