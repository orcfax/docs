# What is an oracle?
Oracles like [Orcfax](https://orcfax.io/), [Chainlink](https://chain.link),
[Charli3](https://charli3.io), etc. are the technical component in blockchain
architectures that deliver information about the real-world to on-chain smart contracts.

The name is derived from people in the ancient world who delivered messages and
knowledge from the gods to the mortals.

Software oracles process information from online sources such as website content
and open datasets but mostly from server-based application programming
interfaces (API). These are the most common types of oracles and are used, for
example, by algorithmic stablecoins or automated market maker (AMM) exchanges to
monitor for changes in currency exchange rates.

Hardware oracles collect and publish information from physical sources such as
sensors and barcode scanners. These are found in supply-chain scenarios or earth
data use cases such as tree planting verification.
