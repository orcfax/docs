# The Orcfax ISPO

Orcfax launched its Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO) in
the Cardano blockchain’s 400th epoch. An ISPO is a fund-raising mechanism that
is popular within the Cardano blockchain community. The basic principle is that
ADA delegators forgo their ADA staking rewards each epoch (5 days) in return
for a proportionate share of a particular Cardano native token. In Orcfax’s
case that is $FACT, the utility token used for publication fees, staking,
rewards, and voting within the Orcfax DAO.

The Orcfax ISPO successfully concluded in epoch 413, and the Orcfax pool
retired in epoch 424. To conclude this phase, Orcfax published both an ISPO
[Retrospective](/files/2023-07-07--Orcfax-ISPO-reflection.pdf) and a [dashboard][ispo-2] breaking down the ISPO.

## How did reward distribution work?

100M $FACT was made available to delegators through a partnership with
[TosiDrop][tosi-1] across a 6 month vesting period. Participants were able to
claim 1/6 of their rewards each month by visiting the site and inputting the
stake address used during the ISPO.

## How can I calculate my rewards?

Participants can use the Orcfax Rewards

Simply enter the stake address used during the ISPO campaign.
