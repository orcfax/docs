# $FACT token

## 1. Where can I find the Orcfax tokenomics?

You can find the tokenomics in our ISPO [Prospectus](https://orcfax.io/assets/Orcfax-ISPO-Prospectus--March15-2023.pdf). Our CEO Peter also participated in a [Twitterspace](https://twitter.com/i/status/1647964885009965061) with Xerberus.io where the Orcfax Tokenomics were discussed in more detail.

## 2. Is $FACT a utility token?

Yes. $FACT is a true utility token used for staking and rewards in our decentralized oracle pools. Itâ€™s also the token used to pay for 1st block access to premium data feeds.


## 3. Is there a governance function to $FACT tokens?

For now, $FACT tokens will be used primarily as utility tokens for validator nodes in our decentralized oracle pool; they will also be used by developer/smart contracts that want to pay for datum from one of our fact statement feeds. However, the long-term plan for Orcfax is for it to run 100% autonomously, with maintenance & governance handled by a true DAO. In this DAO, $FACT will have a voting function. With that said, the token will also be available on open market/DEXs which will provide additional opportunities for token holders.

## 4. Where's the Orcfax NFT sale?

There is no identified utility for this product within our project. Because of this, there is no plan to issue an Orcfax NFT of any kind.
