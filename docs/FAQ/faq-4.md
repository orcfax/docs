# What is the real world?

![Facts lead to truths](/img/2023-09-05--Orcfax--The-Nature-Of-Facts.png)

A fact is something that is known to have happened or to exist, especially
something for which proof exists, or about which there is information.
(Cambridge Dictionary, 2021)

Truths can be interpretive, opinionated, exclusionary, contextual or personal,
e.g. "this cylinder makes pretty shadows that are blue and circular".

[Fact statements](what-is-a-fact) are more definitive, e.g.
"the name of this image file is what-is-true.png"
