# The Orcfax ISPO

The Orcfax oracle project launched its Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO) in the
Cardano blockchain’s 400th epoch. An ISPO is a fund-raising mechanism that is
popular within the Cardano blockchain community. The basic principle is that ADA
delegators forgo their ADA staking rewards each epoch (5 days) in return for a
proportionate share of a particular Cardano native token. In Orcfax’s case that
is $FACT, the utility token used for fees, staking, and rewards in the Orcfax
decentralized oracle pool network.

The Orcfax ISPO successfully concluded in epoch 413, and the Orcfax pool retired
in epoch 424. To conclude this phase, Orcfax published both an ISPO
[Retrospective](/img/2023-07-07--Orcfax-ISPO-reflection.pdf) and a
[dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/christian.koch3382/viz/OrcfaxISPO--Vis/OrcfaxISPOBreakdown) breaking down the ISPO.

# How will reward distribution work?

100M $FACT will be made available to delegators through a partnership with
TosiDrop within a 6 month vesting period. Participants ill be able to claim 1/6
of their rewards each month.

# How can I calculate my rewards?

Participants can use the Orcfax Rewards [Calculator](https://rewards.orcfax.io/)
to check the rewards earned by participating in the ISPO. Simply enter the stake
address.
