# FAX ISPO


The following answers deal exclusively with questions regarding the Orcfax Initial Stake Pool offering, which was initiated in Epoch 400.

&nbsp;

## 1. What are the Orcfax ISPO Pool Details?

| Pool Name | Orcfax Stake Pool |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| Pool Ticker | FAX |
| Pool ID | pool10s6zdzdnncnfc200wnlp9endaeud76v424zdnurx9askwshm02x |
| Owner | Orcfax Ltd. (British Virgin Islands) |
| Pool Margin | 99% |
| Token ticker | $FACT |
| Reward formula | 1 $FACT for every 10 ADA staked (plus loyalty bonuses per epoch) |
| Distribution | $FACT tokens earned during the Orcfax ISPO will become available to delegators via Tosidrop.io within a 6 month vesting period. |
| Start & Duration | The ISPO began with Cardano epoch 400 and will run until the 100 million allocated $FACT tokens have been distributed [^1]. | 

&nbsp;

## 2. Where can I find the Rewards Calculator?

Delegators can find our Rewards Calculator [here](https://rewards.orcfax.io/)

&nbsp;

## 3. What is the “Early Supporter” Bonus?

The “Early Supporter” bonus is a reference to the tiered loyalty bonuses outlined in our ISPO Prospectus (pg.2). Delegators are incentivized to join earlier in order to maximize their $FACT returns with the maximum bonus capped at 50%.

&nbsp;

## 4. How are loyalty bonuses calculated?

Delegators will unlock loyalty bonus tiers based on their longest consecutive delegation. This is captured with am opening snapshot for each epoch. 
    
For Example: Suppose a Delegator stakes 1000 ADA in epoch 400, then delegates to another pool in epoch 404. At this point, the delegator has successfully delegated 4 epochs with Orcfax. Now suppose that same delegator returns in epoch 410 and delegates an additional 2 epochs before leaving again. The longest continuous staking period is 4 epochs, so they are not eligible for a loyalty bonus since the first loyalty tier requires 5 (or more) consecutive epochs.

&nbsp;

## 5. How will reward distribution work?
    
100M $FACT will be made available to delegators through a partnership with [TosiDrop](https://www.tosidrop.io/) within a 6 month vesting period.

&nbsp;

## 6. When will my rewards be available on TosiDrop?
    
Epoch 437 is the first epoch where you will find your rewards in Tosidrop. After that, disbursements will be released every 6 epochs per our vesting schedule [^2] until we reach the end of the vesting period.

**Disbursement schedule**:

| Drop | Epoch | Date |
| :-----: | :-----:| :-----: |
| 1st | 437 | 2023-9-17 |
| 2nd | 443 | 2023-10-17 |
| 3rd | 449 | 2023-11-16 |
| 4th | 455 | 2023-12-16 |
| 5th | 461 | 2024-01-15 |
| 6th | 467 | 2024-02-14 |

&nbsp;

## 7. What happens to the Orcfax Pool after the ISPO?

We are not planning to continue the Orcfax stake pool after the allocated 100M $FACT has been distributed. Once the ISPO has completed, delegators will need to move their stake to another SPO at that time. Orcfax is an oracle project, not a SPO, we will stick to our core business which is reporting authentic facts. While we appreciate this unique opportunity to raise project funds, we also respect and appreciate the Cardano SPO community and understand that our Orcfax ISPO is temporarily taking away business from them.
