# What is the oracle problem?

The oracle problem is used to refer to the issues and trust required around
validating the authenticity and accuracy of [real world](what-is-the-real-world)
data that is reported to trustless blockchain
[smart contracts](what-is-a-smart-contract).

There is an introductory section in our docs that delves into the
[oracle problem](problem-statement) a litte further.
