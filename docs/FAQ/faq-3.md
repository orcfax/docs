# The $FACT Launch
On September 8th, Orcfax launched the $FACT utility token in collaboration with
the Wingriders’ Launchpad, and quickly reached the max contributions, raising
4.5 million ADA! We are grateful to have such an engaged and supportive
community help us secure the funding that will allows us to make our shared
vision of decentralization a reality; this funding will be instrumental in our
expansion and the continued development highlighted by our roadmap.

On September 15th, the launchpad closed and the first FACT/ADA liquidity pool
came online with Wingriders.

On September 22nd, the Minswap liquidity pool came online.

On  September 25th, the Sundae Swap liquidity pool came online.

# What is the Fact policy ID?
It has been reported that multiple fake FACT tokens, and pools, have been found.

# Where can I participate in yield farming?
On September 15th, users had the opportunity to add liquidity, and stake LP
tokens on WingRiders' [liquidity pool](https://app.wingriders.com/pools/026a18d04a0c642759bb3d83b12e3344894e5c1c7b2aeb1a2113a5702b4e632bf755fe5e33309a47216aa396106641edd056423e2ef2a08ce30bb604)
before epoch 438, in order to start receiving double yield rewards (FACT + WRT).
Each epoch, during that first month, we added an allocation of 200,000 FACT and
10,000 WRT for the liquidity providers.

On September 23rd, Minswap opened the ADA-FACT farm. Orcfax has allocated 70,000
FACT tokens for the first two weeks (5000 FACT per day), and we will re-evaluate
the allocation every two weeks. Furthermore, Orcfax has
[proposed](https://forum.minswap.org/t/add-fact-min-yield-farming-to-the-ada-fact-pool/4364)
a double FACT-MIN farm with the Minswap community— by voting and supporting this
, users stand a chance to earn $FACT, $MIN and $ADA yield farming rewards on
Minswap! Add your liquidity, and stake your LP tokens on
[Minswap Farms](https://app.minswap.org/farm) to start receiving yield farming
rewards.

We have created a comprehensive guide on Yield Farming with Wingriders and
Minswap. Learn more about Yield Farming and how to engage in the farms by
