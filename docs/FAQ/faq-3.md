# The $FACT Launch

On September 8th 2023, Orcfax launched the $FACT utility token in collaboration
with the Wingridersâ€™ Launchpad, and quickly reached the max contributions,
raising 4.5 million ADA! We are grateful to have such an engaged and supportive
community help us secure the funding that will allows us to make our shared
vision of decentralization a reality; this funding will be instrumental in our
expansion and the continued development highlighted by our [roadmap](roadmap).

On September 15th, the launchpad closed and the first FACT/ADA liquidity pool
came online with Wingriders.

<!-- Do we need to keep this kind of info? Just something we need to remember to
update -->
Yield farming rewards are available on both Wingriders and Minswap.

## What is the Fact policy ID?

It has been reported that multiple fake FACT tokens, and pools, have been
found. **Always** check our FACT Policy ID before making any trades:

## Where can I participate in yield farming?

On September 15th, users had the opportunity to add liquidity, and stake LP
tokens on WingRiders' [liquidity pool][lq-1] before epoch 438, in order to start
receiving double yield rewards (FACT + WRT). Each epoch, during that first
month, we added an allocation of 200,000 FACT and 10,000 WRT for the liquidity
providers.

On September 23rd, Minswap opened the ADA-FACT farm. Orcfax has allocated
70,000 FACT tokens for the first two weeks (5000 FACT per day), and we will
re-evaluate the allocation every two weeks. Furthermore, Orcfax has
[proposed][prop-1] a double FACT/MIN [farm][lq-2] with the Minswap community.

We have created a comprehensive guide on Yield Farming with Wingriders and
Minswap. Learn more about yield farming and how to engage in the farms by
reading and following the steps in this [article][med-1].
