# Cardano Open Oracle Protocol

The Orcfax team has developed the Open Oracle Protocol as as Cardano Catalyst
funded research project that maximizes the eUTXO model and design principles
to demonstrate a cost-senstive, post-Vasil native method to post secure, signed,
datums on-chain for Reference Input consumption by Cardano dApps.

The first version was developed in collaboration with MLabs consultants. The
Orcfax team has since onboarded all its own Plutus development in-house and
expanded on the beta-version of COOP to issue a version 1.0 which includes a
full schema.org, JSON-LD compliant Cardano datum specification that anchors
machine-readable fact-statements in the worlds' most decentralized and stable
L1 blockchain network.
