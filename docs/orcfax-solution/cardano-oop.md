# Cardano Open Oracle Protocol

The Orcfax team has developed the [Open Oracle Protocol](coop) as as Cardano
[Catalyst funded](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/62613) research project
that maximizes the eUTXO model and design principles to demonstrate a
cost-senstive, post-Vasil native method to publish secure, signed, datums
on-chain for Reference Input consumption by Cardano dApps.

The [first version](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/cardano-open-oracle-protocol/)
was developed in collaboration with George and Drazen from MLabs consultancy.
The Orcfax team has since onboarded all its own Plutus development in-house and
expanded on the beta-version of COOP to issue a version 1.0. This includes a
full schema.org, JSON-LD compliant Cardano datum specification that anchors
machine-readable fact-statements in the worlds' most decentralized and stable L1
blockchain network.
