## 2. Agile software development

## 3. Open-source software development

## 4. Research-driven design

## 5. Standards-compliance

## 6. Implement Cardano Open Oracle Protocol
The Orcfax team has developed the Cardano Open Oracle Protocol as a Catalyst
funded research project that maximizes the eUTXO model and design principles to
demonstrate a cost-senstive, post-Vasil native method to publish secure, signed,
datums on-chain for Reference Input consumption by Cardano dApps.

The first version was developed in collaboration with George and Drazen from MLabs
consultancy. The Orcfax team has since onboarded all its own Plutus development
in-house and expanded on the beta-version of COOP to issue a version 1.0. This
includes a full schema.org, JSON-LD compliant Cardano datum specification that
anchors machine-readable fact-statements in the worlds' most decentralized and stable
L1 blockchain network.

## 6. Distributed, secure-computing best practices

## 7. Full decentralization is a mission, not a pitch
