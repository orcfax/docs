# The Orcfax Protocol

Orcfax is in the middle of critical development ahead of its release of the v1
Orcfax Protocol solution. This section will be updated closer to its release
so that users may familiarize themselves with the upgraded architecture.

R&D on the protocol is ongoing, and our team continues to find ways to bring
value to Orcfax products. While external contractors were leveraged in the past
to develop collaboratively alongside the Orcfax development team, Orcfax has
made the decision to onboard its own Plutus development in-house. This
investment into our development capabilities has allowed us to efficiently and
productively develop towards our upcoming release.

The updated v1 deployment of the Orcfax Protocol will include, among other
things, an improved datum structure to further increased cost efficiency and
ease of integration for dApps.
