# Orcfax Feed metadata schemas

Orcfax distinguishes between oracle feed types and develops specific methods for
representing and publishing data pertaining to those types. In order to increase
interoperability and value downstream, Orcfax has leveraged Schema.org
ontologies to mark up the records resulting from its processes.

## Current Exchange Rate

Feeds such as ADA-USD and FACT-ADA are two examples of feeds of type
current exchange rate (CER); these feeds compare fiat-fiat, fiat-crypto, and
crypto-crypto currency pairs.
