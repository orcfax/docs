The Cardano open oracle protocol (COOP) was designed to take advantage of the
Cardano CIP-31 reference inputs enhancement introduced in the Vasil hard fork.

Reference inputs allow a data provider to publish a data point once and multiple
consumers to use the data point in on-chain dApp scripts, without interfering
with each other.
