# Cardano Open Oracle Protocol

The Orcfax oracle service uses Cardano Open Oracle Protocol (COOP) to publish
and format its data feeds.

COOP is a set of technical guidelines that specifies a process and format for
the publication and consumption of off-chain data by smart contracts on the
Cardano blockchain.

COOP is free and open-source and can be implemented by other projects to
architect their own Cardano oracle feeds.
