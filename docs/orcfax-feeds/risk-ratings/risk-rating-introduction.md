# Introduction to Risk Ratings

Risk Ratings represent additional data that can be used in smart contracts to
trigger specific events (e.g. the risk of a given CNT increasing or decreasing
against a set threshold). A decrease in a token's risk rating could trigger an
investment opportunity, while a decrease in risk ratings could prompt a
liquidation event.

Orcfax believes that providing these values through its oracle service as inline
datum can better support DeFi use cases.
