# Verify fact statements

Every published Orcfax fact statement (starting with our ADA/USD-USD/ADA feed)
is archived to the decentralized [Arweave](https://arweave.org) storage network
via our [Arkly.io](https://arkly.io/about/) Web3 archiving service.

Check out the latest fact statements for our ADA/USD feed at
[Explorer.Orcfax.io](https://explorer.orcfax.io). Click on a fact statement card
to see the detailed summary for that fact statement. The Archive Explorer widget
provides a viewer to all the audit log files.
