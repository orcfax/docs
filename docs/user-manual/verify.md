# Verify fact statements

Every published Orcfax fact statement (starting with our ADA/USD-USD/ADA feed)
is archived to the decentralized **[Arweave](https://arweave.org)** storage
network via our **[Arkly.io](https://arkly.io/about/)** Web3 archiving service.

Check out the latest fact statements for our ADA/USD feed at
**[explorer.orcfax.io](https://explorer.orcfax.io)**. Give it a couple of
seconds to load, its querying Arweave's GraphQL interface to find the latest
Cardano Open Oracle Protocol datum publications.

Click on a fact statement card to see the detailed summary for that fact
statement. The Archive Explorer widget loads the archival package from the
Arweave network (via Arkly.io) and provides a viewer for all the audit log
files.

These include the original HTTP responses from the Kraken, Kucoin, and Coinbase
APIs that the Orcfax validator nodes all queried in unison for ADA/USD order
book data.
