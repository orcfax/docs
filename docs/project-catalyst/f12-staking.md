# Orcfax staking: rewarding good behaviour

R&D into Orxfax Network staking funded through the Catalyst F12 campaign.

This page will provide documentation pertaining to the execution of the proposal
and links to each of the deliverables required for their respective Milestones.
The full Catalyst proposal can be found [here][cat-1].

[cat-1]:
    https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/12/f12-cardano-use-cases-concept/orcfax-staking-rewarding-good-behaviour

## Problem statement

Game theory remains under-utilized within Cardano. As we progress to full
decentralization, Cardano dApps need more tools and protocols to incentivize
desired behaviour while mitigating bad actors.

### Proposed solution

Orcfax will research staking mechanisms for Web3 networks, design an
architecture stack of relevant tools and protocols, and develop a proof of
concept for testing in our validator network.

## Milestone 1

Orcfax produced a research report which evaluated current Web3 staking protocols
and tools available to Cardano projects With the hope that the exercise would
inform proof-of-concept development in subsequent milestones.

Orcfax conducted research over a sample set of staking protocols with a limited
initial understanding of the staking protocol landscape with the hope that the
exercise would inform future development by Orcfax.

This research and its findings can be found [here][staking-research]

## Milestone 2

Orcfax will produce the following:

-   Economic model report
-   Use case descriptions
-   Network architecture diagrams

## Milestone 3

Orcfax will produce software code that demonstrates how a validator node
operator can:

-   deposit testFACT stake
-   receive testFACT rewards
-   have testFACT slashed for non-conformant behaviour

## Final Milestone
