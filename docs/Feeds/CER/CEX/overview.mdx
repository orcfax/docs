It's possible to create a download to a file, see below - but the file is in
the static pages.

Locally the address is: `http://localhost:3000/schema/cer/cex/file.json` so
maybe we can adopt a similar pattern?

Maybe a CDN (content delivery network) can redirect to files like that if need
be in future?

## file embedded from static dir

<CodeBlock language="jsx">{fileOne}</CodeBlock>

<a target="_blank" href="/schema/cer/cex/file.json" download="file.json">Download</a>

## file embedded from local dir, i.e. not static files

<CodeBlock language="jsx">{fileTwo}</CodeBlock>

<a target="_blank" href="./file2.json" download="file.json">Download doesn't work</a>

> NB. I don't think it can be downloaded from here though, so it needs to be
in static files.
