Orcfax is a decentralized [oracle service](oracle-basics) that publishes facts
about real world events to the [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) blockchain.

Orcfax data is made available to on-chain smart contracts in Cardano's
[eUTXO native](cardano) format using the [Cardano Open Oracle Protcol](coop)
(COOP).
