# Introduction

Orcfax is a decentralized **[oracle][oracle-1]** service
designed to publish data about real world events to the
**[Cardano][cardano-1]** blockchain in a way that fully addresses the oracle
problem which has impeded the decentralization initiative since the desire to
build services on top of blockchain ledgers. The oracle feeds issued by Orcfax
are used to publish accurate and independently verifiable facts about the real
world by collecting and aggregating multiple primary data sources while
providing full audit logs of the complete oracle processâ€“ this enables Orcfax to
deliver authentic and accurate data that users can trust but verify. The Orcfax
solution will initially offer currency price-pair feeds but will expand to
report on myriad and diverse feed types according to market demand.

Orcfax data is made available to on-chain **[smart contracts][smart-1]** in
Cardano's eUTXO native format using the
**[Cardano Open Oracle Protocol][coop-1]** (COOP).
