# Introduction

Orcfax is a decentralized **[oracle](oracle-basics#what-is-an-oracle)** service
designed to publish data about real world events to the
**[Cardano](https://medium.com/coinmonks/why-cardano-in-2023-b481846028bc)**
blockchain in a way that fully addresses the oracle problem which has impeded
the decentralization initiative since the desire to build services on top of
blockchain ledgers. The oracle feeds issued by Orcfax are used to publish
accurate and independently verifiable facts about the real world by collecting
and aggregating multiple primary data sources while providing full audit logs of
the complete oracle processâ€“ this enables Orcfax to deliver authentic and
accurate data that users can trust but verify. The Orcfax solution will
initially offer currency price-pair feeds but will expand to report on myriad
and diverse feed types according to market demand.

Orcfax data is made available to on-chain
**[smart contracts](oracle-basics#what-is-a-smart-contract)** in Cardano's eUTXO
native format using the **[Cardano Open Oracle Protocol][coop-1]** (COOP).
