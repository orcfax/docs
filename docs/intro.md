# Introduction

Orcfax is a decentralized **[oracle][oracle-1]** service
designed to publish data about real world events to the
**[Cardano][cardano-1]** blockchain. Orcfax data is made available to on-chain
**[smart contracts][smart-1]** in Cardano's eUTXO native format using the
Orcfax Protocol.

Orcfax collects and validates facts about
the real world using multiple redundant nodes that are run as a decentralized
network. Just as importantly, Orcfax archives standards-compliant audit log
packages for the entire oracle publication workflow. This allows Orcfax users to
"trust but verify" that Orcfax is delivering authentic and accurate data.

The Orcfax solution has launched by offering currency price-pair feeds but will
expand to report on diverse types of other real-world facts as oracle use cases,
and their importance beyond blockchain domains, becomes more important to
society at large.
