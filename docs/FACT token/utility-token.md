# FACT utility
The Orcfax platform includes a Cardano-native utility token named FACT.

The FACT token is used for:

1. Payment for on-demand, oracle data publication
2. Staking by our data validator nodes
3. Reward payments to validators
4. Voting power in Orcfax DAO governance decisions

The $FACT token will first become available on the open market via the
[Wingriders Launchpad](https://medium.com/@orcfax/orcfax-token-launch-in-collaboration-with-wingriders-launchpad-39d63da2b379).

There is a fixed supply of [1 Billion FACT tokens](tokenomics) with 50% reserved
for validator node rewards.
