# FACT Tokenomics
The FACT [utility token](utility-token) has a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens.

The FACT token minting policy ID is
[a3931691f5c4e65d01c429e473d0dd24c51afdb6daf88e632a6c1e51](https://pool.pm/asset1kuwfd0esf9xcxurp2x4f9w65lvz4tkfw5epugq).

The FACT token is tradeable on
[Cardano DEX markets](https://www.taptools.io/charts/token?pairID=026a18d04a0c642759bb3d83b12e3344894e5c1c7b2aeb1a2113a570.2b4e632bf755fe5e33309a47216aa396106641edd056423e2ef2a08ce30bb604). It is listed

to the allocations in the FACT tokenomics pie chart above. Using these ADA
handles allows for public transparency and project accountability on when FACT
tokens are moved and used.

## Validator rewards
A full 50% of our token supply is reserved to reward our validator node
operators for collecting, formatting, validating, publishing and archiving
real-world data for consumption as eUTXO datum by Cardano dApps and smart
contracts.

This allocation is meant to subsdize operations long enough for the network to
become self-sustaining based on fee collection. This allocation is a serious
signal that Orcfax understands a healthy, thriving validator pool network is
required for the long-term viability and value of the network.

## ISPO
An Initial Stakepool Offering (ISPO) is a mechanism popular within the Cardano
blockchain community. The basic principle is that ADA delegators forego their
ADA staking rewards each epoch in return for a proportionate share of the
project token.

Orcfax successfully ran a
[fully-subscribed ISPO](https://github.com/orcfax/orcfax.github.io/blob/main/assets/Orcfax--ISPO-Reflection--July7-2023.pdf)
in March 2023. The cliff date for the first ISPO drops is September 2023. 10% of
the FACT token supply is allocated to ISPO participants.

## Launchpad & LP Bootstrapping
Orcfax used the [Wingriders Launchpad](https://medium.com/@orcfax/orcfax-token-launch-in-collaboration-with-wingriders-launchpad-39d63da2b379)
to introduce the FACT token to the open market and make it available for
circulation. This launchpad supports a decentralized and non-custodial method
for initial price discovery.

86,000,000 (8.6%) FACT is allocated as collateral for ADA contributed by
Launchpad participants. 24,000,000 (2.4%) is allocated for bootstrapping the
first liquidity pool on the Wingriders DEX which will follow the launchpad.

The 86 million Launchpad FACT tokens have no cliff and/or vesting restrictions.
They can be claimed in full as soon as the launchpad closes.

The 24 million FACT tokens used to bootstrap the Liquidity Pool will have a
cliff date of 6 months after the Launchpad closes (12 months from the start of
the ISPO) and a one month vesting period.

## Yield Farming APY
20,000,000 (2%) FACT tokens are used to enhance the appeal of our liquidity
pool(s) by offering substantial Yield Farming Rewards to our liquidity
providers.

## Promotional airdrops
This allocation is used to raise awareness about Orcfax by giving away FACT
through various public relations campaigns.

## Ecosystem
This allocation is for future partnerships, (centralized) exchange
liquidity, marketing campaigns and developer grants. It will also be used to
fund research and to develop tools and services that contribute to the health
and growth of the Orcfax ecosystem.

## Foundation
This allocation will be used to launch the Orcfax DAO and seed a treasury for
ongoing Orcfax DAO foundation activities.

## Team
This allocation is distributed to the founder and team members to compensate for
their significant investments in time and effort to launch the Orcfax network.

## Advisors
External advisors that provide guidance and support to the Orcfax project are
compensated in FACT from this allocation.
