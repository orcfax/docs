## Validator rewards
The biggest allocation is reserved to reward our decentralized validators for
running Orcfax nodes.

500,000,000 (50%) $FACT have been allocated for rewarding Orcfax validator node
operators for collecting, formatting, validating, publishing and archiving
real-world data for consumption as eUTXO datum by Cardano dApps and smart
contracts.

This allocation is meant to subsidize operations long enough for the network to
become self-sustaining based on fee collection. This allocation is a serious
signal that Orcfax understands a healthy, thriving validator pool network is
required for the long-term viability and value of the network.

This allocation has a cliff date or vesting schedule. However, How it is paid
out to validators will be made public after the close of the Orcfax Incentivized
Testnet.

## Promotional airdrops
10,000,000 (1%) $FACT have been allocated for raising awareness for our project
and to promote Orcfax. This will be done by utilizing the allocated tokens by
way of $FACT airdrops and giveaways. The project will also leverage this
allocation in various public relations campaigns going forward.

This allocation has a cliff date of 3 months after the start of the ISPO and a 6
month vesting period.

## Team
150,000,000 (15%) $FACT have been allocated for disbursement among the founding
team; this allocation will be distributed to the founder and team members in
order to compensate for their significant investments, both in time and effort
to launch the Orcfax network.

This allocation has a cliff date of 3 months after the start of the ISPO and a
24 month vesting period.

## Advisors
10,000,000 (1%) $FACT have been allocated for external advisors that provide
guidance and support to the Orcfax project with specialized expertise. These
advisors will be compensated in $FACT from this allocation.

This allocation has a cliff date of 3 months after the start of the ISPO and a
24 month vesting period.

## Ecosystem
50,000,000 (5%) $FACT have been allocated for developing future partnerships,
marketing campaigns, developer grants, funding research, and for tools that
contribute to the project’s overall ecosystem.

This allocation has a cliff date of 6 months after the start of the ISPO and a 6
month vesting period.

## Launchpad & LP Bootstrapping
Orcfax used the [Wingriders Launchpad](https://medium.com/@orcfax/orcfax-token-launch-in-collaboration-with-wingriders-launchpad-39d63da2b379)
to introduce the FACT token to the open market and make it available for
circulation. this was done to raise funds for continued project development via
a decentralized and non-custodial process. This launchpad supports a
decentralized and non-custodial method for initial price discovery and the
initial bootstrapping of a liquidity pool.

86,000,000 (8.6%) $FACT was allocated as collateral for ADA contributed by
Launchpad participants. 24,000,000 (2.4%) was allocated for bootstrapping the
first liquidity pool on the Wingriders DEX which followed the launchpad.

The 86,000,000 Launchpad $FACT have no cliff and/or vesting restrictions. They
can be claimed in full as soon as the launchpad closes.

## Token foundation
50,000,000 (5%) $FACT have been allocated for use in developing and the
subsequent launch of the Orcfax DAO. The allocation will also be utilized to
seed the initial treasury, which will be used by the Orcfax DAO foundation to
fund ongoing activities.

This allocation has a cliff date of 12 months after the start of the ISPO and a
6 month vesting period.

## ISPO
100,000,000 (10%) $FACT were allocated for use in the successful Orcfax ISPO
which started on March 15th 2023. Our reflection on the process can be found
[here](https://docs.orcfax.io/assets/files/2023-07-07--Orcfax-ISPO-reflection-0212f8cd59e995f75fc8d5c0ad2625e7.pdf).
The ISPO was the first and only way for our early supporters to acquire $FACT by
delegating ADA to our ISPO pool.

An ISPO is a mechanism popular within the Cardano blockchain community.
The basic principle is that ADA delegators forgo their ADA staking rewards each
epoch in return for a proportionate share of a project’s token. The Orcfax
reflection on this mechanism was made available to the public on July 7th, 2023.

The cliff date for the first ISPO drops was September 2023, with 10% of the
total $FACT supply allocated to ISPO participants. This allocation has a cliff
date of 6 months after the start of the ISPO and a 6 month vesting period (i.e.
distributed monthly, for 6 months).

## Yield Farming APY
20,000,000 (2%) FACT tokens are used to enhance the appeal of our liquidity
pool(s) by offering substantial Yield Farming Rewards to our liquidity
providers.

These tokens have no cliff and/or vesting restrictions.
